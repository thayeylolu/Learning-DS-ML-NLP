### Electronic Meidcal Records - Classiifer
A Classifier from the given dataset that identifies the medical specialty. This will help in improving the search for an electronic medical record (EMR) system. We are adding filters for medical specialties when searching through patient notes.

This Part is not included in the competition. This is completely up to the individual/team :
Sort the specialties by how semantically cohesive they are. For example, maybe the Neurology specialty would be better split into Neurology - Brain and Neurology - Peripheral Nerves, while Endocrinology should remain a single category because the transcriptions in that category are mutually similar.
