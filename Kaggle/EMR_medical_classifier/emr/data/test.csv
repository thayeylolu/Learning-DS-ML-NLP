1," Acute lymphocytic leukemia in remission, removal of venous port.", Removal of Venous Port ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Acute lymphocytic leukemia in remission.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Acute lymphocytic leukemia in remission.,OPERATION PERFORMED:  ,Removal of venous port.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,INDICATIONS: , This 9-year-old young lady presented with ALL in Orange County and had a port placed at that time.  She subsequently has now undergone chemotherapy here and is now off therapy.  She no longer needs her venous port so, comes to the operating room today for its removal.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , After the induction of general anesthetic, the exit site was prepped and draped in usual manner.  The previous incision was opened by excising the old scar.  The port pocket was then opened and the port was removed from the pocket.  There was a resistance to the catheter being removed and so therefore, we began following the catheter along its path opening the tract until finally the catheter seemed to come free and could be pulled out without difficulty.  The port pocket was then closed using a #3-0 Vicryl in subcutaneous tissue, #5-0 subcuticular Monocryl in the skin.  Sterile dressing was applied.  Young lady was awakened and taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition."
2, Laparoscopic appendectomy.  Acute appendicitis., Laparoscopic Appendectomy ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Acute appendicitis.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Acute appendicitis.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:,  Laparoscopic appendectomy.,INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: , Include inflamed, non-perforated appendix.,OPERATIVE NOTE:  ,The patient was seen by me in the preoperative holding area.  The risks of the procedure were explained.  She was taken to the operating room and given perioperative antibiotics prior to coming to the surgery.  General anesthesia was carried out without difficulty and a Foley catheter was inserted.  The left arm was tucked and the abdomen was prepped with Betadine and draped in sterile fashion.  A 5-mm blunt port was inserted infra-umbilically at the level of the umbilicus under direct vision of a 5-mm 0-degree laparoscope.  Once we were inside the abdominal cavity, CO2 was instilled to attain an adequate pneumoperitoneum.  A left lower quadrant 5-mm port was placed under direct vision and a 12-mm port in the suprapubic region.  The 5-mm scope was introduced at the umbilical port and the appendix was easily visualized.  The base of the cecum was acutely inflamed but not perforated.  I then was easily able to grasp the mesoappendix and create a window between the base of the mesoappendix and the base of the appendix.  The window is big enough to get an Endo GIA blue cartridge through it and fired across the base of the mesoappendix without difficulty.  I reloaded with a red vascular cartridge, came across the mesoappendix without difficulty.  I then placed the appendix in an Endobag and brought out through the suprapubic port without difficulty.  I reinserted the suprapubic port and irrigated out the right lower quadrant until dry.  One final inspection revealed no bleeding from the staple line.  We then removed all ports under direct vision, and there was no bleeding from the abdominal trocar sites.  The pneumoperitoneum was then deflated and the suprapubic fascial defect was closed with 0-Vicryl suture.  The skin incision was injected with 0.25% Marcaine and closed with 4-0 Monocryl suture.  Steri-strips and sterile dressings were applied.  No complications.  Minimal blood loss.  Specimen is the appendix.  Brought to the recovery room in stable condition."

8," The patient has had abdominal pain associated with a 30-pound weight loss and then developed jaundice.  He had epigastric pain and was admitted to the hospital.  A thin-slice CT scan was performed, which revealed a pancreatic mass with involved lymph nodes and ring enhancing lesions consistent with liver metastases. ", Pancreatic Mass - Discharge Summary ,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: ,  The patient is a 48-year-old man who has had abdominal pain since October of last year associated with a 30-pound weight loss and then developed jaundice.  He had epigastric pain and was admitted to the hospital.  A thin-slice CT scan was performed, which revealed a 4 x 3 x 2 cm pancreatic mass with involved lymph nodes and ring enhancing lesions consistent with liver metastases.  The patient, additionally, had a questionable pseudocyst in the tail of the pancreas.  The patient underwent ERCP on 04/04/2007 with placement of a stent.  This revealed a strictured pancreatic duct, as well as strictured bile duct.  A 10-french x 9 cm stent was placed with good drainage.  The next morning, the patient felt quite a bit more comfortable.  He additionally had a modest drop in his bilirubin and other liver tests.  Of note, the patient has been having quite a bit of nausea during his admission.  This responded to Zofran.  It did not, initially, respond well to Phenergan, though after stent placement, he was significantly more comfortable and had less nausea, and in fact, had better response to the Phenergan itself.  At the time of discharge, the patient's white count was 9.4, hemoglobin 10.8, hematocrit 32 with a MCV of 79, platelet count of 585,000.

There is also evidence of bilateral internal as well as external nasal valve collapse.,INDICATIONS:  ,The patient is a pleasant 49-year-old gentleman who had undergone a previous septorhinoplasty after significant trauma in his 20s.  He now presents with significant upper airway resistance and nasal obstruction and is unable to tolerate a CPAP machine.  Therefore, for repair of the above-mentioned deformities including the internal and external nasal valve collapse as well as straightening of the deviated septum, the risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed with him included but not limited to bleeding, infection, septal perforation, need for further surgeries, external deformity, and he desired to proceed with surgery.,DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room and laid supine upon the OR table.  After the induction of general endotracheal anesthesia, the nose was decongested using Afrin-soaked pledgets followed by the injection of % lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine in the submucoperichondrial planes bilaterally.  Examination revealed significant deviation of the nasal septum and the bony cartilaginous junction as well as the large septal spur along the floor.  The caudal septum appeared to be now in adequate position.  There was evidence that there had been a previous caudal septal graft on the right nares and it was decided to leave this in place.  Following the evaluation of the nose, a hemitransfixion incision was made on the left revealing a large septal spur consisting primarily down on the floor of the left nostril creating nearly a picture of the vestibular stenosis on the side.  Very carefully, the mucoperichondrial flaps were elevated over this, and it was excised using an osteotome taking care to preserve the 1.5 cm dorsal and caudal strap of the nasal septum and keep it attached to the nasal spine.  Very carefully, the bony cartilaginous junction was identified and a small piece of the bone, where the spur was, was carefully removed.  Following this, it was noted that the cartilaginous region was satisfactory in quantity as well as quality to perform adequate grafting procedures.  Therefore, attention was turned to harvesting the right-sided auricular cartilage, which was done after the region had adequately been prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  Postauricular incision using a #15 blade, the area of the submucoperichondrial plane was elevated in order to preserve the nice lining and identifiable portion of the cartilage taking care to preserve the ridge of the helix at all times.  This was very carefully harvested.  This area had been injected previously with 1% lidocaine and 1:100,000 epinephrine.  Following this, the cartilage was removed.  It was placed in saline, noted to be fashioned in the bilateral spreader graft and alar rim graft as well as a small piece of crush which was used to be placed along the top of the dorsal irregularity.  The spreader grafts were sutured in place using submucoperichondrial pockets.  After an external septorhinoplasty approach had been performed and reflection of the skin and soft tissue envelope had been performed, adequately revealing straight septum with significant narrowing with what appeared to be detached perhaps from his ipsilateral cartilages rather from his previous surgery.  These were secured in place in the pockets using a 5-0 PDS suture in a mattress fashion in two places.  Following this, attention was turned to placing the alar rim grafts where pockets were created along the caudal aspect of the lower lateral cartilage and just along the alar margin.  Subsequently, the alar rim grafts were placed and extended all the way to the piriform aperture.  This was sutured in place using a 5-0 self-absorbing gut suture.  The lower lateral cartilage has had some inherent asymmetry.  This may have been related to his previous surgery with some asymmetry of the dome; however, this was left in place as he did not desire any changes in the tip region, and there was adequate support.  An endodermal suture was placed just to reenforce the region using a 5-0 PDS suture.  Following all this, the area was closed using a mattress 4-0 plain gut on a Keith needle followed by the application of ***** 5-0 fast-absorbing gut to close the hemitransfixion incision.  Very carefully, the skin and subcutaneous tissue envelopes were reflected.  The curvilinear incision was closed using a Vicryl followed by interrupted 6-0 Prolene sutures.  The marginal incisions were then closed using 5-0 fast-absorbing gut.  Doyle splints were placed and secured down using a nylon suture.  They had ointment also placed on them.  Following this, nasopharynx was suctioned.  There were no further abnormalities noted and everything appeared to be in nice position.  Therefore, an external splint was placed after the application of Steri-Strips.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  He was awakened in the operating room.  He was extubated and taken to the recovery room in stable condition."

12, Arthroplasty of the right second digit.  Hammertoe deformity of the right second digit., Arthroplasty - Hammertoe ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Hammertoe deformity of the right second digit.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Hammertoe deformity of the right second digit.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Arthroplasty of the right second digit.,The patient is a 77-year-old Hispanic male who presents to ABCD Hospital for surgical correction of a painful second digit hammertoe.  The patient has failed attempts at conservative treatment and is unable to wear shoes without pain to his second toe.  The patient presents n.p.o. since mid night last night and consented to sign in the chart.  H&P is complete.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  After an IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area, the patient was escorted to the operating room and placed on the table in the supine position.  Using Webril, the distal leg and ankle was padded and a ankle pneumatic tourniquet was placed around the right ankle, but left deflated at this time.  Restraining, a lap belt was then placed around the patient's abdomen while laying on the table.  After adequate anesthesia was administered by the Department of Anesthesia, a local digital block using 5 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain was used to provide local anesthesia.  The foot was then prepped and draped in the normal sterile orthopedic manner.  The foot was then elevated and Esmarch bandage was applied, after which time the tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg.  The foot was then brought down to the level of the table and stockinet was cut and reflected after the Esmarch bandage was removed.  A wet and dry sponge was then used to cleanse the operative site and using a skin skribe a dorsal incisional line was outlined extending from the proximal phalanx over the proximal interphalangeal joint on to the middle phalanx.,Then using a fresh #15 blade, a dorsolinear incision was made, partial thickness through the skin after testing anesthesia with one to two pickup.  Then using a fresh #15 blade, incision was deepened and using medial to lateral pressure, the incision was opened into the subcutaneous tissue.  Care was taken to reflect the subcutaneous tissue from the underlying deep fascia to mobilize the skin.  This was performed with the combination of blunt and dull dissection.  Care was taken to avoid proper digital arteries and neurovascular bundles as were identified.  Attention was then directed to the proximal interphalangeal joint and after identifying the joint line, a transverse linear incision was made over the dorsal surface of the joint.  The medial and lateral sides of the joint capsule were then also incised on the superior half in order to provide increased exposure.  Following this, the proximal portion of the transected extensor digitorum longus tendon was identified using an Adson-Brown pickup.  It was elevated with fresh #15 blade.  The tendon and capsule was reflected along with the periosteum from the underlying bone dorsally.  Following this, the distal portion of the tendon was identified in a like manner.  The tendon and the capsule as well as the periosteal tissue was reflected from the dorsal surface of the bone.  The proximal interphalangeal joint was then distracted and using careful technique, #15 blade was used to deepen the incision and while maintaining close proximity to the bone and condyles, the lateral and medial collateral ligaments were freed up from the side of the proximal phalanx head.,Following this, the head of the proximal phalanx was known to have adequate exposure and was freed from soft tissues.  Then using a sagittal saw with a #139 blade, the head of he proximal phalanx was resected.  Care was taken to avoid the deep flexor tendon.  The head of the proximal phalanx was taken with the Adson-Brown and using a #15 blade, the plantar periosteal tissue was freed up and the head was removed and sent to pathology.  The wound was then flushed using a sterile saline with gentamicin and the digit was noted to be in good alignment.  The digit was also noted to be in rectus alignment.  Proximal portion of the tendon was shortened to allow for removal of the redundant tendon after correction of the deformity.  Then using a #3-0 Vicryl suture, three simple interrupted sutures were placed for closure of the tendon and capsular tissue.  Then following this, #4-0 nylon was used in a combination of horizontal mattress and simple interrupted sutures to close the skin.  The toe was noted to be in good alignment and then 1 cc of dexamethasone phosphate was injected into the incision site.  Following this, the incision was dressed using a sterile Owen silk soaked in saline and gentamicin.  The toe was bandaged using 4 x 4s, Kling, and Coban.  The tourniquet was deflated and immediate hyperemia was noted to the digits I through V of the right foot.,The patient was then transferred to the cart and was escorted to the Postanesthesia Care Unit where the patient was given postoperative surgical shoe.  Total tourniquet time for the case was 30 minutes.  While in the recovery, the patient was given postoperative instructions to include, ice and elevation to his right foot.  The patient was given pain medications of Tylenol #3, quantity 30 to be taken one to two tablets every six to eight hours as necessary for moderate to severe pain.  The patient was also given prescription for cane to aid in ambulation.  The patient will followup with Dr. X on Tuesday in his office for postoperative care.  The patient was instructed to keep the dressings clean, dry, and intact and to not remove them before his initial office visit.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and the anesthesia with no complications."
13, A woman with a remote history of ileojejunal bypass followed by gastric banding to facilitate weight loss. , Wound Care Consult ,"TYPE OF CONSULTATION:,  Wound care consult.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  The patient is a 62-year-old woman with a past medical history significant for prior ileojejunal bypass for weight loss (1980) and then subsequent gastric banding (2002 Dr. X) who was transferred to this facility following a complicated surgical and postoperative course after takedown of the prior gastroplasty and bypass (07/08/2008, Dr. Y).  The patient has been followed by Cardiothoracic Surgery (Dr. Z) as an outpatient.  She had a history of daily postprandial vomiting, regurgitation, and heartburn.  She underwent a preop assessment of her GERD and postprandial vomiting including nuclear gastric emptying studies, which showed increased esophageal retention with normal gastric emptying.  Preoperative barium swallow demonstrated moderated esophageal dysmotility with incomplete emptying and a small hiatal hernia.  It was recommended that she undergo an exploratory laparotomy and possible redo fundoplication and possible gastrectomy.  She had already undergone multiple EGDs with dilatations without success.  She continued to have abdominal discomfort.,On 07/07/2008, she was admitted to hospital.  She underwent an exploratory laparotomy with esophagogastrectomy with esophagogastric anastomosis and Dor fundoplication, repair of hiatal hernia, small bowel resection x2 with primary anastomosis, extensive lysis of adhesions, insertion of a red-rubber J tube, and esophagogastroduodenoscopy.  She also had her ileojejunal bypass reversed.  Postoperatively, she was able to be extubated.  She was started on TPN, given the risk of not being able to tolerate enteral nutrition.  Her operative note confirmed that the stomach pouch was enlarged with outlet obstruction where the band was.  There was 2 hours of extensive lysis of adhesions.  It took 2 hours to identify the colon.  A defect was repaired in the transverse colon.  The bypass segment of the anastomosis was seen between the proximal jejunum and the distal ileum, which was divided and the proximal jejunum was reconnected to the atretic blind limb of the small bowel.  A red feeding tube was placed proximal to the anastomosis then tended to cross the anastomosis into the distal atretic small bowel for enteral feeds.  The hiatal hernia was repaired as noted.  The obstructed proximal gastric segment was resected.  An anastomosis was made between the proximal intestine and the stomach and distal esophagus with Dor fundoplication.  Omentectomy was performed due to devascularization.  The wound was able to be closed with staples.,Postoperatively, the patient was started on IV antibiotics.  She was able to be extubated.  However, on 07/14/2008, she coded with shortness of breath and chest pain.  She had respiratory failure, required endotracheal intubation and ICU management.  CT scan of the abdomen and the pelvis confirmed that she had an anastomotic leak.  Sputum cultures were positive ESBL Klebsiella.  Blood cultures were negative.  She was managed closely for sepsis with an elevated white cell count.  She was also febrile.  Her chest x-ray also showed left lower lobe consolidation.  She had scattered contrast material in the anterior abdomen and left upper quadrant due to the anastomotic leak.  Her antibiotics were adjusted.  Of note, the patient did have a JP drain placed out to the surface during her initial surgery.  Followup CT scan on 07/16/2008 confirmed the anastomosis as the likely site of a fistula, as there was continued extraluminal enteric contrast seen within anterior abdomen just beneath the peritoneum as well as the left upper quadrant adjacent to the spleen.  No enteric contrast was seen surrounding the patient's known GE junction leak.  A JP drain was noted at the posterior aspect of the fundoplication.  There was only a small amount of pelvic fluid.  Follow up scan again on 07/25/2008 showed no abscess formation.  On 08/05/2008, she did underwent an advancement of the #14 French red-rubber catheter feeding tube distal to the dehiscence of fistula into the distal small bowel.  At the beginning of the procedure, the catheter did appear to traverse through an anastomotic suture line in the wound dehiscence.  At some point during her course, the patient did undergo a second operative procedure, but I do not have any operative note at this time.  She subsequently was left with a large open abdominal defect, which was being managed by the wound care nurses, which at the time of her transfer to this facility was being managed with a ""wound manager system."" to low-continuous wall suction.  She was also transferred on tube feedings via the red rubber catheter 20 mL per hour.  She is only to have her tube feeds increased by 10 mL a week to ensure tolerance.  During her course, she was started on TPN.  She was transferred on TPN here.,At the time of her transfer, the patient was no longer on IV antibiotics.  She is on Fragmin for DVT prophylaxis.  During her course, she did have to undergo a tracheostomy.  This has subsequently been removed and this site is healing.  The tracheostomy was removed on 08/06/2008, I believe.  At the time of her tracheostomy (on 07/22/2008), the patient also underwent a flexible bronchoscopy, which showed some secretions in the left airway (right was clear), which did not appear to be purulent.  Of note also, pathology of her partial stomach resection showed Helicobacter pylori gastritis.  There were no other significant abnormalities noted in the small intestine or omentum.  On 08/11/2008, the patient was transferred to HealthSouth Monroeville LTAC for continued medical management, wound care, and rehab therapies.1,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  ,History of diabetes with peripheral neuropathy - on Lyrica and Cymbalta preoperatively.  History of hypothyroidism, history of B12 deficiency related to prior gastric surgeries, history of osteoarthritis, history of valvular disease (no details available), and cardiac arrhythmias.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:,  Status post bilateral total knee replacements, status post right rotator cuff repair, status post sigmoid colectomy - no further details available, status post right breast lumpectomy for benign lesion, history of bladder repair, status post hysterectomy/tonsillectomy/appendectomy, history of lumbar spinal fusion - no further details available.  History of MRSA in knees (previous surgery).,ALLERGIES:,  MULTIPLE INCLUDING TETRACYCLINE, ERYTHROMYCIN, MORPHINE, SULFA DRUGS, BETADINE, ADHESIVE TAPES, AND BANDAGE.,SOCIAL HISTORY:,  Prior to admission, the patient lived alone in a one storied dwelling.  She does have some equipment at home including a powered wheelchair, which she uses for longer distance.  She does have some ambulatory devices also.  She used to smoke, but quit about 10 years ago.  She smoked 1 to 2 packs a day from age 18 to 54.  She does not smoke.,FAMILY HISTORY:,  Remarkable for cardiac disease with early death of her father at age 43 and mother had Alzheimer.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , According to her notes, the patient's weight 07/10/2008 was 256 pounds.  She has a BMI of 44 indicating morbid obesity.  She had had a significant weight loss in the 6 months prior to this of 7%.  As noted, she is on TPN and enteral feeds.  Her prealbumin level noted on 07/10/2008 was low at 7.  Prior to admission, the patient ate a regular diet, but had most likely weight loss and inadequate intake due to her chronic postprandial vomiting and esophageal dysmotility.  She is currently NPO with NG to suction.  The patient has no complaints of abdominal pain or discomfort at the time of this exam.  She was awake and alert.  MRSA screen on 07/14/2008 was negative.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,General:  The patient is a morbidly obese woman, who is in no acute distress at the time of this exam.  She is lying comfortably on a low air loss mattress.  She had just been assisted with cleaning up and had no complaints of pain or discomfort.,Vital Signs:  Temperature is 98.9, pulse is 95, blood pressure is 123/69, and weight is 239 pounds.,HEENT:  Normocephalic/atraumatic.  Extraocular muscles intact.  Her mentation is good.,Neck:  Stout.  There is good range of motion.,Cor:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs appreciated.,Lungs:  Fairly clear anteriorly.,Abdomen:  Remarkable for a large open abdominal wound with a collection system in place covering the entire wound in midline.  There is a JP drain and a red rubber catheter present.  At present, the wound manager system is somewhat collapsed.  She had just been on her side.  It is connected to low continuous wall suction and removing fluid.,Musculoskeletal:  There is PICC line present in the right upper extremity.  No significant pedal edema.  Bilateral knee scars from prior surgeries.,Skin:  Reported intact at this time (not seen by me).,Neurological:  Cranial nerves II through XII grossly intact.  She is able to answer questions appropriately.  She is able to raise both arms over head.  She is able to raise her legs, but does need assistance.  She has fair bed mobility and requires much assistance for any turning.  Gait and transfers not tested.,SUMMARY: , In summary, the patient is a 62-year-old woman with a remote history of ileojejunal bypass followed by gastric banding to facilitate weight loss.  However, she subsequently developed reflux associated with postprandial vomiting, which was found to be secondary to esophageal retention.  On 07/08/2008, she underwent exploratory laparotomy with esophagogastrectomy with esophagogastric anastomosis and Dor fundoplication, hiatal hernia repair, small bowel resection, and lysis of adhesions.  She has had a fairly rocky postoperative course and has subsequently underwent some type of re-exploration after she was noted to have enteric contents draining from her JP drain with confirmed anastomotic leak.  She has undergone placement on an NG tube.  At present, she is on enteral feeds as well as TPN.  During all these, she also coded and had respiratory failure, requiring vent management, but this has improved.  Her trach has been removed and this site is healing.  From the wound standpoint, her largest problem at this point is the abdominal wound, which is open.  A wound manager system is currently in place, which is connected to low intermittent wall suction for drainage of the enteral contents still present. At present, the drainage is quite yellow in appearance.  She has no significant complaints of pain at this time.  At some point in her notes, there was mention of a negative pressure wound therapy being used to this wound, but this cannot be confirmed at this time.  I will plan to contact Dr. Z's office to see whether or not they wanted to resume a wound VAC system to this wound.  For now, we will continue with wound manager system.  We will need to keep track of in's and out's of drainage from this site.  Her fluid status will need to be monitored.  In an attempt to get her mobilized, we will need extra care to be sure that this wound dressing/management system stays in place.  She is eager and motivated to get mobilized.  We will plan to ask Plastic (Dr. A) to be involved in following this wound also.  Again, I will plan to call the surgeon's office for further directions.  She is to follow up with Dr. Z in 2 weeks.,Later in afternoon, I was able to reach Dr. Z's office.  I was called back by one of his nurses, who advised me that a wound VAC (negative pressure wound therapy) was not to be used on this wound.  They are using the wound manager system.  She did report that the confusion came about with the inability during her discharge summary dictation that she was only able to cite a ""wound VAC"" when describing the system that was in place on the patient.  She was using a formatted discharge summary program.  At present, the patient has had some leakage from the system.  According to my discussion with our wound care coordinator at this time, this system has been removed, with leakage repaired, and replaced with another wound manager system with suctioning continuing.  Pictures were also taken of the wound bed.  There were several staples apparently in place.  I was not present at the time that this system had to be changed."

Xylocaine 2% with epinephrine was injected beneath the conjunctiva and skin of the lower lid and also beneath the conjunctiva and skin of the upper lid.  A frontal nerve block was also given on the right upper lid.  The anesthetic agent was also injected in the right preauricular region which would provide a donor graft for the right lower lid defect.  The area was marked with a marking pen with margins of 3 to 4 mm, and a #15 Bard-Parker blade was used to make an incision at the nasal and temporal margins of the lesion.,The incision was carried inferiorly, and using a Steven scissors the normal skin, muscle, and conjunctiva was excised inferiorly.  The specimen was then marked and sent to pathology for frozen section.  Bleeding was controlled with a wet-field cautery, and the right upper lid was everted, and an incision was made 3 mm above the lid margin with the Bard-Parker blade in the entire length of the upper lid.  The incision reached the orbicularis, and Steven scissors were used to separate the tarsus from the underlying orbicularis.  Vertical cuts were made nasally and temporally, and a large dorsal conjunctival flap was fashioned with the conjunctiva attached superiorly.  It was placed into the defect in the lower lid and sutured with multiple interrupted 6-0 Vicryl sutures nasally, temporally, and inferiorly.,The defect in the skin was measured and an appropriate large preauricular graft was excised from the right preauricular region.  The defect was closed with interrupted 5-0 Prolene sutures, and the preauricular graft was sutured in place with multiple interrupted 6-0 silk sutures.  The upper border of the graft was attached to the upper lid after incision was made in the gray line with a Superblade, and the superior portion of the skin graft was sutured to the upper lid through the anterior lamella created by the razor blade incision.,Cryotherapy was then used to treat the nasal and temporal margins of the area of excision because of positive margins, and following this an antibiotic steroid ointment was instilled and a light pressure dressing was applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to recovery room in good condition."

He failed nonoperative management.  We discussed the risks, benefits, and possible complications of operative and continued nonoperative management, and he gave his fully informed consent to the following procedure.,OPERATIVE REPORT IN DETAIL: , The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position on the operating room table.  After adequate induction of general anesthesia, he was placed in the left lateral decubitus position.  All bony prominences were padded.  The right shoulder was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner using standard Betadine prep, entered through three standard arthroscopic portals anterolateral and posterior incising the skin with a knife using sharp and blunt trocar.,Serial examination of the intraarticular portion of the shoulder showed all the structures to be normal including the biceps tendon ligaments, articular surfaces, and labrum.  Subacromial space was entered.  Visualization was poor due to the hemorrhagic bursitis, and this was resected back.  It was essentially a type-3 acromion, which was converted to a type 1 by aiming the burr anterior from the posterior portal excising the larger anterior spur.  Rotator cuff was little bit fray, but otherwise intact.  Thus, the deep deltoid bursa and the markedly thickened coracoacromial ligament were removed.  The burr was then introduced to the anterior portal and the distal clavicle excision carried out.  The width of burr about 6 mm being careful to preserve the ligaments in the capsule, but removing the spurs and the denuded arthritic joint.,The patient tolerated the procedure very well.  The shoulder was then copiously irrigated, drained free of any residual debris.  The wound was closed with 3-0 Prolene.  Sterile compressive dressing applied.,The patient was then placed on his back in the supine position and the right upper extremity and the left lower extremity were prepped and draped in usual sterile manner using a standard Betadine prep.,The attention was first turned to the right hand where it was elevated, exsanguinated using an Esmarch bandage, and the tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg for about 25 minutes.  Volar approach to the carpal ligament was performed incising the skin with a knife and using cautery for hemostasis.  Tenotomy and forceps dissection carried out through the superficial palmar fascia, carried down to the volar carpal ligament, which was then transected sharply with a knife and carried proximal and distal under direct vision using the scissors being careful to avoid the neurovascular structures.,Cautery was used for hemostasis.  The never had an hourglass appearance where it was a kind of constricted as a result of the compression from the ligament, and so a small amount of Celestone was dripped onto the nerve to help quite it down.  The patient tolerated this portion of the procedure very well.  The hand was then irrigated, closed with Monocryl and Prolene, and sterile compressive dressing was applied and the tourniquet deflated.,Attention was then turned to the left knee where it was entered through inferomedial and inferolateral portals incising the skin with a knife and using sharp and blunt trocars.  After entering the knee through inferomedial and inferolateral standard arthroscopic portals, examination of the knee showed a displaced bucket-handle tear in the medial meniscus and a radial tear at the lateral meniscus.  These were resected back to the stable surface using a basket forceps and full-radius shaver.  There was no evidence of any other significant arthritis in the knee.  There was a lot of synovitis, and so after the knee was irrigated out and free of any residual debris, the knee was injected with Celestone and Marcaine with epinephrine.,The patient tolerated the procedure very well, and the wounds were closed with 3-0 Prolene and sterile compressive dressing was applied, and then the patient was taken to the recovery room, extubated, awake, alert, and in stable condition."

Following this, the knee was sterilely prepped and draped as discussed for this procedure.  The inferolateral and inferomedial portals were then established; however, prior to this, a graft was harvested from the semitendinosus and gracilis region.  After the notch was identified, then ACL was confirmed and ruptured.  There was noted to be a torn, slipped up area of the medial meniscus, which was impinging and impinged on the articular surface.  The snare was smoothed out.  Entire area was thoroughly irrigated.  Following this, there was noted in fact to be significant degenerative changes from this impingement of the meniscus again to the periarticular cartilage.  The areas of the worn away portion of the medial femoral condyle was then debrided and ________ chondroplasty was then performed of this area in order to stimulate bleeding and healing.  There were multiple loose bodies noted in the knee and these were then __________ and then removed.  The tibial and femoral drill holes were then established and the graft was then put in place, both which locations after a notchplasty was performed.  The knee was taken through a full range of motion without any impingement.  An Endobutton was used for proximal fixation.  Distal fixation was obtained with an independent screw and a staple.  The patient was then taken to Postanesthesia Care Unit at the conclusion of the procedure.,"
17," Removal of infected sebaceous cyst, right neck.", Sebaceous Cyst Removal ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Infected sebaceous cyst, right neck.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Infected sebaceous cyst, right neck.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was electively taken to the operating room after obtaining an informed consent.  With a combination of intravenous sedation and local infiltration anesthesia, a time-out process was followed and then the patient was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  The elliptical incision was performed around the draining tract.  Immediately we fell in to an abscess cavity with a lot of pus and necrotic tissue.  All the necrotic tissue was excised together with an ellipse of skin.  Hemostasis was achieved with a cautery.  The cavity was irrigated with normal saline.  At the end of procedure, there was a good size around cavity that was packed with iodoform gauze.  One skin suture was grazed for approximation.,A bulky dressing was applied.,The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Estimated blood loss was negligible and the patient was sent to Same Day Surgery for recovery."

The patient had the appropriate inflammatory workup for pericardial effusion, however, it was nondiagnostic.", Subxiphoid Pericardiotomy ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Symptomatic pericardial effusion.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Symptomatic pericardial effusion.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,  Subxiphoid pericardiotomy.,ANESTHESIA:,  General via ET tube.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , 50 cc.,FINDINGS:,  This is a 70-year-old black female who underwent a transhiatal esophagectomy in November of 2003.  She subsequently had repeat chest x-rays and CT scans and was found to have a moderate pericardial effusion.  She had the appropriate inflammatory workup for pericardial effusion, however, it was nondiagnostic.  Also, during that time, she had become significantly more short of breath.  A dobutamine stress echocardiogram was performed, which was negative with the exception of the pericardial effusions.  She had no tamponade physiology.,INDICATION FOR THE PROCEDURE: , For therapeutic and diagnostic management of this symptomatic pericardial effusion.  Risks, benefits, and alternative measures were discussed with the patient.  Consent was obtained for the above procedure.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A 4 cm incision was created in the midline above the xiphoid.  Dissection was carried down through the fascia and the xiphoid was resected.  The sternum was retracted superiorly the pericardium was identified and pericardial fat was cleared off the pericardium.  An #0 silk suture was then placed into the pericardium with care taken not to enter the underlying heart.,This suture was used to retract the pericardium and the pericardium was nicked with #15 blade under direct visualization.  Serous fluid exited through the pericardium and was sent for culture, cytology, and cell count etc.  A section of pericardium was taken approximately 2 cm x 2 cm x 2 cm and was removed.  The heart was visualized and appeared to be contracting well with no evidence of injury to the heart.  The pericardium was then palpated.  There was no evidence of studding.  A right angle chest tube was then placed in the pericardium along the diaphragmatic of the pericardium and then brought out though a small skin incision in the epigastrium.  It was sewn into place with #0 silk suture.  There was some air leak of the left pleural cavity, so a right angle chest tube was placed in the left pleural cavity and brought out through a skin nick in the epigastrium.  It was sewn in the similar way to the other chest tube.  Once again, the area was inspected and found to be hemostatic and then closed with #0 Vicryl suture for fascial stitch, then #3-0 Vicryl suture in the subcutaneous fat, and then #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a running subcuticular fashion.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Chest tubes were placed on 20 cm of water suction.  The patient was taken to PACU in stable condition."

She has no connective tissue disorders.,PAST OCULAR HISTORY: , Significant for cataract and glaucoma surgery of the right eye.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , On examination, visual acuity measures hand motions on the right and 20/25 in the left.  There is an afferent pupillary defect on the right.  On examination, there is a right hypertropia.  There is dense anterior chamber inflammation on the right eye with a stagnant aqueous.  There is either neovascularization on the iris or reactive iris vessels, it is difficult to discern.  This seems to be complete iris synechia to the anterior lens capsule.  There is a posterior chamber intraocular lens with an inflammatory debris on the anterior surface.  The anterior chamber appears narrow.  On the left, there is also dense inflammation at 4+ cell.  There is 1+ nuclear sclerosis.  Dilated fundus examination cannot be performed on the right secondary to intense inflammation.  On the left, there is no evidence of active posterior uveitis.  There is some inferior vitreous debris.,ASSESSMENT/PLAN:,  Chronic bilateral recurrent nongranulomatous diffuse uveitis.  Currently, there is very severe right eye inflammation and severe left eye.  I discussed at length with the patient that this will likely take an oral steroid to quite her down.  Since she has only one seeing eye, I am anxious to obtain a decreased inflammation as soon as possible.  She has been on oral steroids in the past.  We also discussed, considering the aggressive recurrent nature of this process, it is likely we will have to consider a steroid sparing agent to maintain longer term control of this recurrent process so that we do not use visual acuity in the left.  I anticipate we will likely start methotrexate in the near future.  In this acute phase, I have recommended oral steroids at a dose of 60 mg a day, hourly topical Pred Forte as well as atropine sulfate.  We will watch her closely in clinic.  I am sending a copy of this dictation to her primary care doctor, she said she has had a negative HLA-B27, rheumatoid factor, and ANA in the past.  At this stage, to be thorough I would ask Dr. X to assist us in repeating her chest x-ray, PPD if not current, and an RPR.  Additionally, in anticipation of need for methotrexate, it would be helpful to have a full liver function profile as well as hepatitis B and hepatitis C."

Risks, benefits, alternatives of the procedures were discussed in great detail with the patient.  Risks include but were not limited to anesthesia, bleeding, infection, injury to nerve, vocal fold paralysis, hoarseness, low calcium, need for calcium supplementation, tumor recurrence, need for additional treatment, need for thyroid medication, cosmetic deformity, and other.  The patient understood all these issues and they wished to proceed.,PREOP DIAGNOSIS: , Multinodular thyroid goiter with compressive symptoms and bilateral dominant thyroid nodules proven to be benign by fine needle aspiration.,POSTOP DIAGNOSIS: , Multinodular thyroid goiter with compressive symptoms and bilateral dominant thyroid nodules proven to be benign by fine needle aspiration.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal.,PROCEDURE DETAIL: , After identifying the patient, the patient was placed supine in a operating room table.  After establishing general anesthesia via oral endotracheal intubation with a 6 Nerve Integrity monitoring system endotracheal tube.  The eyes were then tacked with Tegaderm.  The Nerve Integrity monitoring system, endotracheal tube was confirmed to be working adequately.  Essentially a 7 cm incision was employed in the lower skin crease of the neck.  A 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine were given.  Shoulder roll was applied.  The patient prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  A 15-blade was used to make the incision.  Subplatysmal flaps were raised to the thyroid notch and sternal respectively.  The strap muscles were separated in the midline.  As we then turned to the left side where the sternohyoid muscle was separated from the sternothyroid muscle there was a very dense and firm thyroid mass on the left side.  The sternothyroid muscle was transected horizontally.  Similar procedure was performed on the right side.,Attention was then turned to identify the trachea in the midline.  Veins in this area and the pretracheal region were ligated with a harmonic scalpel.  Subsequently, attention was turned to dissecting the capsule off of the left thyroid lobe.  Again this was very firm in nature.  The superior thyroid pole was dissected in the superior third artery, vein, and the individual vessels were ligated with a harmonic scalpel.  The inferior and superior parathyroid glands were protected.  Recurrent laryngeal nerve was identified in the tracheoesophageal groove.  This had arborized early as a course underneath the inferior thyroid artery to a very small tiny anterior motor branch.  This was followed superiorly.  The level of cricothyroid membrane upon complete visualization of the entire nerve, Berry's ligament was transected and the nerve protected and then the thyroid gland was dissected over the trachea.  A prominent pyramidal level was also appreciated and dissected as well.,Attention was then turned to the right side.  There was significant amount of thyroid tissue that was very firm.  Multiple nodules were appreciated.  In a similar fashion, the capsule was dissected.  The superior and inferior parathyroid glands protected and preserved.  The superior thyroid artery and vein were individually ligated with the harmonic scalpel and the inferior thyroid artery was then ligated close to the thyroid gland capsule.  Once the recurrent laryngeal nerve was identified again on this side, the nerve had arborized early prior to the coursing underneath the inferior thyroid artery.  The anterior motor branch was then very fine, almost filamentous and stimulated at 0.5 milliamps, completely dissected toward the cricothyroid membrane with complete visualization.  A small amount of tissue was left at the Berry's ligament as the remainder of thyroid level was dissected over the trachea.  The entire thyroid specimen was then removed, marked with a stitch upon the superior pole.  The wound was copiously irrigated, Valsalva maneuver was given, bleeding points controlled.  The parathyroid glands appeared to be viable.  Both the anterior motor branches that were tiny were stimulated at 5 milliamps and confirmed to be working with the Nerve Integrity monitoring system.,Attention was then turned to burying the Surgicel on the wound bed on both sides.  The strap muscles were reapproximated in the midline using a 3-0 Vicryl suture of the sternothyroid horizontal transection and the strap muscles in the midline were then reapproximated.  The 1/8th inch Hemovac drain was placed and secured with a 3-0 nylon.  The incision was then closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl and Indermil for the skin.  The patient has a history of keloid formation and approximately 1 cubic centimeter of 40 mg per cubic centimeter Kenalog was injected into the incisional line using a tuberculin syringe and 25-gauge needle.  The patient tolerated the procedure well, was extubated in the operating room table, and sent to postanesthesia care unit in a good condition.  Upon completion of the case, fiberoptic laryngoscopy revealed intact bilateral true vocal fold mobility."
21," Tonsillectomy, uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, and septoplasty for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome with hypertrophy of tonsils and of uvula and soft palate with deviation of nasal septum", Tonsillectomy and Septoplasty ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome with hypertrophy of tonsils and of uvula and soft palate.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome with hypertrophy of tonsils and of uvula and soft palate with deviation of nasal septum.,OPERATION:,  Tonsillectomy, uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, and septoplasty.,ANESTHESIA:,  General anesthetics.,HISTORY: , This is a 51-year-old gentleman here with his wife.  She confirms the history of loud snoring at night with witnessed apnea.  The result of the sleep study was reviewed.  This showed moderate sleep apnea with significant desaturation.  The patient was unable to tolerate treatment with CPAP.  At the office, we observed large tonsils and elongation and thickening of the uvula as well as redundant soft tissue of the palate.  A tortuous appearance of the septum also was observed.  This morning, I talked to the patient and his wife about the findings.  I reviewed the CT images.  He has no history of sinus infections and does not recall a history of nasal trauma.  We discussed the removal of tonsils and uvula and soft palate tissue and the hope that this would help with his airway.  Depending on the findings of surgery, I explained that I might remove that bone spur that we are seeing within the nasal passage.  I will get the best look at it when he is asleep.  We discussed recovery as well.  He visited with Dr. XYZ about the anesthetic produce.,PROCEDURE:,:  General tracheal anesthetic was administered by Dr. XYZ and Mr. Radke.  Afrin drops were placed in both nostrils and a cottonoid soaked with Afrin was placed in each side of the nose.  A Crowe-Davis mouth gag was placed.  The tonsils were very large and touched the uvula.  The uvula was relatively long and very thick and there were redundant folds of soft palate mucosa and prominent posterior and anterior tonsillar pillars.  Also, there was a cryptic appearance of the tonsils but there was no acute redness or exudate.  Retraction of the soft palate permitted evaluation of the nasopharynx with the mirror and the choanae were patent and there was no adenoid tissue present.  A very crowded pharynx was appreciated.  The tonsils were first removed using electrodissection technique.  Hemostasis was achieved with the electrocautery and with sutures of 0 plain catgut.  The tonsil fossae were injected with 0.25% Marcaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine.  There already was more room in the pharynx, but the posterior pharyngeal wall was still obscured by the soft palate and uvula.  The uvula was grasped with the Alice clamp.  I palpated the posterior edge of the hard palate and calculated removal of about a third of the length of the soft palate.  We switched over from the Bayonet cautery to the blunt needle tip electrocautery.  The planned anterior soft palate incision was marked out with the electrocautery from the left anterior tonsillar pillar rising upwards and then extending horizontally across the soft palate to include all of the uvula and a portion of the soft palate, and the incision then extended across the midline and then inferiorly to meet the right anterior tonsillar pillar.  This incision was then deepened with the electrocautery on a cutting current.  The uvular artery just to the right of the midline was controlled with the suction electrocautery.  The posterior soft palate incision was made parallel to the anterior soft palate incision but was made leaving a longer length of mucosa to permit closure of the palatoplasty.  A portion of the redundant soft palate mucosa tissue also was included with the resection specimen and the tissue including the soft palate and uvula was included with the surgical specimen as the tonsils were sent to pathology.  The tonsil fossae were injected with 0.25% Marcaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine.  The soft palate was also injected with 0.25% Marcaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine.  The posterior tonsillar pillars were then brought forward to close to the anterior tonsillar pillars and these were sutured down to the tonsil bed with interrupted 0 plain catgut sutures.  The posterior soft palate mucosa was advanced forward and brought up to the anterior soft palate incision and closure of the soft palate wound was then accomplished with interrupted 3-0 chromic catgut sutures.  A much improved appearance of the oropharynx with a greatly improved airway was appreciated.  A moist tonsil sponge was placed into the nasopharynx and the mouth gag was removed.  I removed the cottonoids from both nostrils.  Speculum exam showed the inferior turbinates were large, the septum was tortuous and it angulated to the right and then sharply bent back to the left.  The septum was injected with 0.25% Marcaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine using a separate syringe and needle.  A #15 blade was used to make a left cheilion incision.,Mucoperichondrium and mucoperiosteum were elevated with the Cottle elevator.  When we reached the deflected portion of the vomer, this was separated from the septal cartilage with a Freer elevator.  The right-sided mucoperiosteum was elevated with the Freer elevator and then with Takahashi forceps and with the 4 mm osteotome, the deflected portion of the septal bone from the vomer was resected.  This tissue also was sent as a separate specimen to pathology.  The intraseptal space was irrigated with saline and suctioned.  The nasal septal mucosal flaps were then sutured together with a quilting suture of 4-0 plain catgut.  I observed no evidence of purulent secretion or polyp formation within the nostrils.  The inferior turbinates were then both outfractured using a knife handle, and now there was a much more patent nasal airway on both sides.  There was good support for the nasal tip and the dorsum and there was good hemostasis within the nose.  No packing was used in the nostrils.  Polysporin ointment was introduced into both nostrils.  The mouth gag was reintroduced and the pack removed from the nasopharynx.  The nose and throat were irrigated with saline and suctioned.  An orogastric tube was placed and a moderate amount of clear fluid suctioned from the stomach and this tube was removed.  Sponge and needle count were reported correct.  The mouth gag having been withdrawn, the patient was then awakened and returned to recovery room in a satisfactory condition.  He tolerated the operation excellently.  Estimated blood loss was about 15-20 cc.  In the recovery room, I observed that he was moving air well and I spoke with his wife about the findings of surgery."
22, A lady with symptoms consistent with possible oligoarticular arthritis of her knees., Oligoarticular Arthritis - 2 ,"HISTORY: , A is a young lady, who came here with a diagnosis of seizure disorder and history of Henoch-Schonlein purpura with persistent proteinuria.  A was worked up for collagen vascular diseases and is here to find out the results.  Also was recommended to take 7.5 mg of Mobic every day for her joint pains.  She states that she continues with some joint pain and feeling tired all the time.  Mother states that also her seizure has continued without any control so far.  She is having some studies in the next few days.  She is mostly stiff on her legs, neck, and also on her hands.  The rest of the review of systems is in the chart.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , ,VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature today is 99.2 degrees Fahrenheit, weight is 45.9 kg, blood pressure is 123/59, height is 149.5 cm, and pulse is 94.,HEENT:  She has no facial rashes, no lymphadenopathy, no alopecia, no oral ulcerations.  Pupils are reactive to accommodation.  Funduscopic examination is within normal limits.,NECK:  No neck masses.,CHEST:  Clear to auscultation.,HEART:  Regular rhythm with no murmur.,ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender with no visceromegaly.,SKIN:  No rashes today.,MUSCULOSKELETAL:  Examination shows good range of motion with no swelling or tenderness in any of her joints of the upper extremities, but she does have minus/plus swelling of her knees with flexion contracture bilaterally on both.,LABORATORY DATA: , Laboratories were not done recently, but we have some lab results from the previous evaluation that basically is negative for any collagen vascular disease, but shows some evidence of decreased calcium and vitamin D levels.,ASSESSMENT: , This is a patient, who today presents with symptoms consistent with possible oligoarticular arthritis of her knees with also arthralgias and deficiency in vitamin D.  She also has chronic proteinuria and seizure disorder.  My recommendation is to start her on vitamin D and calcium supplements, and also increase the Mobic to 50 mg, which is one of the few things she can tolerate with all the medication she is taking.  We are going to refer her to physical therapy and see her back in 2 months for followup.  The plan was discussed with A and her parents and they have no further questions."
23, Ligation and stripping of left greater saphenous vein to the level of the knee.  Stripping of multiple left lower extremity varicose veins.  Varicose veins., Saphenous Vein - Ligation & Stripping ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Varicose veins.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Varicose veins.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1.  Ligation and stripping of left greater saphenous vein to the level of the knee.,2.  Stripping of multiple left lower extremity varicose veins.,ANESTHESIA:,  General endotracheal.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Approximately 150 mL.,SPECIMENS: , Multiple veins.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,BRIEF HISTORY:,  This is a 30-year-old Caucasian male who presented for elective evaluation from Dr. X's office for evaluation of intractable pain from the left lower extremity.  The patient has had painful varicose veins for number of years.  He has failed conservative measures and has felt more aggressive treatment to alleviate his pain secondary to his varicose veins.  It was recommended that the patient undergo a saphenous vein ligation and stripping.  He was explained the risks, benefits, and complications of the procedure including intractable pain.  He gave informed consent to proceed.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS:,  The left greater saphenous vein femoral junction was identified and multiple tributaries were ligated surrounding this region.,The vein was stripped from the saphenofemoral junction to the level of the knee.  Multiple tributaries of the greater saphenous vein and varicose veins from the left lower extremity were ligated and stripped accordingly.  Additionally, there were noted to be multiple regions within these veins that were friable and edematous consistent with acute and chronic inflammatory changes making stripping of these varicose veins extremely difficult.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was marked preoperatively in the Preanesthesia Care Unit.  The patient was brought to the operating suite, placed in the supine position.  The patient underwent general endotracheal intubation.  After adequate anesthesia was obtained, the left lower extremity was prepped and draped circumferentially from the foot all the way to the distal section of the left lower quadrant and just right of midline.  A diagonal incision was created in the direction of the inguinal crease on the left.  A self-retaining retractor was placed and the incision was carried down through the subcutaneous tissues until the greater saphenous vein was identified.  The vein was isolated with a right angle.  The vein was followed proximally until a multiple tributary branches were identified.  These were ligated with #3-0 silk suture.  The dissection was then carried to the femorosaphenous vein junction.  This was identified and #0 silk suture was placed proximally and distally and ligated in between.  The proximal suture was tied down.  Distal suture was retracted and a vein stripping device was placed within the greater saphenous vein.  An incision was created at the level of the knee.  The distal segment of the greater saphenous vein was identified and the left foot was encircled with #0 silk suture and tied proximally and then ligated.  The distal end of the vein stripping device was then passed through at its most proximal location.  The device was attached to the vein stripping section and the greater saphenous vein was then stripped free from its canal within the left lower extremity.  Next, attention was made towards the multiple tributaries of the varicose vein within the left lower leg.  Multiple incisions were created with a #15 blade scalpel.  The incisions were carried down with electrocautery.  Next, utilizing sharp dissection with a hemostat, the tissue was spread until the vein was identified.  The vein was then followed to T3 and in all these locations intersecting segments of varicose veins were identified and removed.  Additionally, some segments were removed.  The stripping approach would be vein stripping device.  Multiple branches of the saphenous vein were then ligated and/or removed.  Occasionally, dissection was unable to be performed as the vein was too friable and would tear from the hemostat.  Bleeding was controlled with direct pressure.  All incisions were then closed with interrupted #3-0 Vicryl sutures and/or #4-0 Vicryl sutures.,The femoral incision was closed with interrupted multiple #3-0 Vicryl sutures and closed with a running #4-0 subcuticular suture.  The leg was then cleaned, dried, and then Steri-Strips were placed over the incisions.  The leg was then wrapped with a sterile Kerlix.  Once the Kerlix was achieved, an Ace wrap was placed over the left lower extremity for compression.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to Postanesthesia Care Unit extubated in stable condition.  He will undergo evaluation postoperatively and will be seen shortly in the postanesthesia care unit."
24," Approximately one and a half years ago, patient fell down while walking in the living room from the bedroom.  At that time, he reports both legs gave away on him and he fell.  He reported that he had some lightheadedness just before he fell and was slightly confused, but was aware of what was happening around him.", Neurologic Consultation - 5 ,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: ,The patient is a 79-year-old right-handed man who reports that approximately one and a half years ago, he fell down while walking in the living room from the bedroom.  At that time, he reports both legs gave away on him and he fell.  He reported that he had some lightheadedness just before he fell and was slightly confused, but was aware of what was happening around him.  He was able to get up shortly after falling and according to the patient and his son, subsequently returned back to normal.,He was then well until the 3rd of July 2008 when his legs again gave way on him.  This was not preceded by lightheadedness.  He was rushed to the hospital and was found to have pneumonia, and the fall was blamed on the pneumonia.  He started using a walker from that time, prior to that he was able to walk approximately two miles per day.  He again had a fall in August of 2008 after his legs gave way.  Again, there was no lightheadedness associated with this.  He was again found to have pneumonia and again was admitted to hospital after which he went to rehabilitation and was able to use his walker again after this.  He did not, however, return to the pre-July baseline.  In October of 2008, after another fall, he was found to have pneumonia again and shingles.  He is currently in a Chronic Rehabilitation Unit.  He cannot use a walker and uses a wheelchair for everything.  He states that his hands have been numb, involving all the fingers of both hands for the past three weeks.  He is also losing muscle bulk in his hands and has noticed some general weakness of his hands.  He does, however, note that strength in his hands has not been normal since July 2008, but it is clearly getting worse.  He has been aware of some fasciculations in his legs starting in August 2008, these are present both in the lower legs and the thighs.  He does not report any cramps, problems with swallowing or problems with breathing.  He reports that he has had constipation alternating with diarrhea, although there has been no loss of control of either his bowel or bladder.  He has had some problems with blood pressure drops, and does feel presyncopal when he stands.  He also reports that he has no feeling in his feet, and that his feet feel like sponges.  This has been present for about nine months.  He has also lost joint position sense in his feet for approximately nine months.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,1.  Pneumonia.  He has had recurrent episodes of pneumonia, which started at approximately age 20.  These have been treated repeatedly over the years, and on average he has tended to have an episode of pneumonia once every five years, although this has been far more frequent in the past year.  He is usually treated with antibiotics and then discharged.  There is no known history of bronchiectasis, inherited lung disease or another chronic pulmonary cause for the repeated pneumonia.,2.  He has had a catheter placed for urinary retention, his urologist has told him that he thinks that this may be due to prostate enlargement.  The patient does not have any history of diabetes and does not report any other medical problems.  He has lost approximately 18 pounds in the past month.,3.  He had an appendectomy in the 1940s.,4.  He had an ankle resection in 1975.,SOCIAL HISTORY:  ,The patient stopped smoking 27 years ago, he smoked approximately two packs a day with combined cigarettes and cigars.  He has not smoked for the past 27 years.  He hardly ever uses alcohol.  He is currently retired.,FAMILY HISTORY: , There is no family history of neuropathy, pes cavus, foot deformities, or neuromuscular diseases.

His pain score was 0.,APPEARANCE:  No acute distress.  He is pleasant and well-groomed.,HEENT:  Atraumatic, normocephalic.  No carotid bruits appreciated.,LUNGS:  There were few coarse crackles in both lung bases.,CARDIOVASCULAR:  Revealed a normal first and second heart sound, with no third or fourth heart sound and no murmurs.  The pulse was regular and of normal volume.,ABDOMEN:  Soft with no masses and normal bowel sounds.  There were no carotid bruits.,EXTREMITIES:  No contractures appreciated.,NEUROLOGICAL EXAM:,MSE:  His orientation, language, calculations, 100-7 tests were all normal.  There was atrophy and fasciculations in both the arms and legs.,CRANIAL NERVES:  Cranial nerve examination was normal with the exception that there was some mild atrophy of his tongue and possible fasciculations.  His palatal movement was normal and gag reflex was normal.,MOTOR:  Strength was decreased in all muscle groups as follows:  Deltoid 4/4, biceps 4+/4+, triceps 5/5, wrist extensors 4+/4+, finger extensors 4-/4-, finger flexors 4-/4-, interossei 4-/4-, hip flexors 4+/4+, hip extensors 4+/4+, knee extensors 4/4, and knee flexors 4/4.  Foot dorsiflexion, plantar flexion, eversion, toe extension and toe flexion was all 0 to 1.  There was atrophy in both hands and general atrophy of the lower limb muscles.  The feet were both cold and showed dystrophic features.  Fasciculations were present mainly in the hands.  There was evidence of dysmetria and past pointing in the left hand.,REFLEXES:  Reflexes were 0 in all sites in the arms and legs.  The jaw reflex was 2+.  Vibration was severely decreased at the elbow and wrist and was absent in the fingers.  Vibration was absent in the toes and ankle bilaterally and was severely decreased at the knee.  Joint position sense was absent in the toes and severely decreased in the fingers.  Pin perception was absent in the feet and was decreased to the upper thighs.  Pin was decreased or absent in the fingers and decreased above the elbows.  The same distribution of sensory loss was found with monofilament testing.,COORDINATION:  Coordination was barely normal in the right hand.  Rapid alternating movements were decreased in the left hand greater than the right hand.  The patient was unable to stand and therefore gait, Romberg's test and balance could not be assessed.,DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: , Previous diagnostic studies and patient reports.  There were extensive patient reports, all of which were reviewed.  A previous x-ray study of the lateral chest performed in October 2008 showed poor inspiration with basilar atelectasis and an infiltrate.  An x-ray of the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine showed some evidence of lumbar spinal stenosis.  A CTA of the neck with and without contrast performed in November 2008 showed minor stenosis in the left carotid, a mild hard and soft plaque in the right carotid with approximately 55% stenosis.  The posterior circulation showed a slightly dominant right vertebral artery with no stenosis.  There was no significant stenosis, but there was minor extracranial stenosis noted.  An MRI of the brain with and without contrast performed in November 2008 showed no evidence of an acute infarct, major vascular occlusion, and no abnormal enhancement with gadolinium administration.  There was also no significant sinusitis or mastoiditis.  This was an essentially normal brain MRI.  A CBC performed in January 2009 showed an elevated white cell count of 11.3, a low red cell count of 3.43, elevated MCH of 32.4 and the rest of the study was normal.  An electrolyte study performed in January 2009 showed a sodium which was low at 127, a calcium which was low at 8.3, and a low protein of 5.2 and albumin of 3.1.  The glucose was 86.  TSH performed in January 2009 was 1.57, which is within the normal range.  Vitamin B12 was greater than a 1000, which is normal and the folate was 18.2, which was normal.  A myocardial stress study performed in December 2008 showed normal myocardial perfusion with Persantine Cardiolite SPECT.  The ECG was non-diagnostic.  There was normal regional wall motion of the left ventricle.  The left ventricular ejection fraction was 68%, which is within the normal range for males.  A CT of the lumbar spine without contrast performed in December 2008 showed a broad-based disc bulge at L1-L2, L2-L3, L3-L4 and L4-L5.  At L5-S1, in addition to the broad-based disc bulge, there was also an osteophyte complex and evidence of flavum hypertrophy without canal stenosis.  There was severe bilateral neural foraminal stenosis at L5-S1 and moderate neural foraminal stenosis at L1-L4.  An echocardiogram was performed in November 2008 and showed mild left atrial enlargement, normal left ventricular systolic function, mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, scleral degenerative changes in the aortic and mitral apparatus, mild mitral regurgitation, mild tricuspid regurgitation and mild to moderate aortic regurgitation.,DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION:  ,The patient presents with a severe neuropathy with marked large fiber sensory as well as motor findings.  He is diffusely weak as well as atrophic in all muscle groups both in his upper and lower extremities, although he is disproportionately weak in his lower extremities.  His proprioceptive and vibratory loss is severe in both the distal upper and lower extremities, signifying that he either has a severe sensory neuropathy or has involvement of the dorsal root ganglia.  According to the history, which was carefully checked, the initial onset of these symptoms goes back one and a half years, although there has only been significant progression in his condition since July 2008.  As indicated below, further diagnostic studies including a detailed nerve conduction and EMG test today showed evidence of a severe sensory, motor, and axonal neuropathy and in addition there was evidence of a diffuse polyradiculopathy.  There was no involvement of the tongue on EMG.  The laboratory testing as indicated below failed to show a specific cause for the neuropathy.  We are still, however, waiting for the paraneoplastic antibodies, which were send out lab to the Mayo Clinic.  This type of very severe sensorimotor neuropathy with significant proprioceptive loss may be seen in several conditions including peripheral nerve vasculitis due to a variety of disorders such as SLE, Sjogren's, rheumatoid arthritis, and mixed connective tissue disease.  In addition, it may also be seen with certain toxins, particularly chemotherapeutic agents.  The patient did not receive any of these.  It may also be seen as part of a paraneoplastic syndrome.  Although the patient does not have any specific clinical symptoms of a cancer, it is noted that he has had an 18-pound weight loss in the past month and does have a remote history of smoking.  We have requested that he obtain a CT of his chest, abdomen and pelvis while he is in Acute Rehabilitation.  The verbal reports of these possibly did not show any evidence of a cancer.  We did also request that he obtain a gallium scan to see if there was any evidence of an unsuspected neoplasm.  The patient did undergo a nerve and muscle biopsy, this was a radial nerve and biceps muscle biopsy from the left arm.  This showed evidence of severe axonal loss.  There was no evidence of a vasculitis.  The vessels did show some mild intimal changes that would be consistent with atherosclerosis.  There were a few perivascular changes; however, there was no clear evidence of a necrotizing vasculitis even on multiple sections.  The muscle biopsy showed severe muscle fiber atrophy, with evidence of fiber grouping.  Again, there was no evidence of inflammation or vasculitis.  Evaluation so far has also shown no evidence of an amyloid neuropathy, no evidence of a monoclonal gammopathy, of sarcoidosis, and again there is no past history of a significant toxin or infective cause for the neuropathy.  Specifically, there is no history of HIV exposure.  We would await the results of the gallium scan and of the paraneoplastic antibodies to see if these are helpful in making a diagnosis.  At this point, because of the severity and the axonal nature of the neuropathy, there is no specific therapy that will reverse the course of the illness, unless we find a specific etiology that can be stopped or reversed.  I have discussed these issues at length with the patient and with his son.  We also addressed whether or not there might be a previously undiagnosed inherited neuropathy.  I think this is unlikely given the short history and the rapid progression of the disorder.,There is also no family history that we can detect a neuropathy, and the patient does not have the typical phenotype for a chronic inherited neuropathy such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2.  However, since I have only seen the patient on one occasion and do not know what his previous examination showed two years ago, I cannot be certain that there may not have been the presence of a neuropathy preceding this.,PLAN:,1.  Nerve conduction and EMG will be performed today.  The results were indicated above.,2.  The following laboratory studies were requested including electrolytes, CBC, thyroid function tests, B12, ANA, C-reactive protein, complement, cryoglobulins, double-stranded DNA antibodies, folate level, hemoglobin A1c, immunofixation electrophoresis, P-ANCA, C-ANCA, protein electrophoresis, rheumatoid factor, paraneoplastic antibody studies requested from the Mayo Clinic, B12.  These studies showed minor changes, which included a low sodium level of 129 as previously noted, a low creatinine of 0.74, low calcium of 8.6, low total protein of 5.7.  The B12 was greater than 2000.  The immunoelectrophoresis, ANA, double-stranded DNA, ANCA, hemoglobin A1c, folate, cryoglobulins, complement, C-reactive protein were all normal or negative.  The B12 level was greater than 2000.  Liver function tests were normal.  The glucose was 90.  ESR was 10.  Hemoglobin A1c was 5.5.,3.  A left radial sensory and left biceps biopsy were requested and have been performed and interpreted as indicated above.,4.  CT of chest, abdomen and pelvis.,5.  Whole body gallium scan for evidence of an underlying neoplasm.,6.  The patient will go to the Rehabilitation Facility for Acute Rehabilitation and Training.,7.  We have not made any changes to his medication.  He does have some mild orthostatic changes; however, he is adequately controlled with midodrine at a dose of 2.5 mg three times a day as needed up to 5 mg four times a day.  Usually, he uses a lower dose of 2.5 three times a day to 5 mg three times a day.,8.  Followup will be as determined by the family."

The femoral vessels were small somewhat thin and there was posterior packing, but satisfactory bypass was performed.", Aortobifemoral Bypass ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Aortoiliac occlusive disease.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:, Aortoiliac occlusive disease.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:, Aortobifemoral bypass.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS: , The patient was taken to the operating room.  The abdominal contents were within normal limits.  The aorta was of normal size and consistency consistent with arteriosclerosis.  A 16x8 mm Gore-Tex graft was placed without difficulty.  The femoral vessels were small somewhat thin and there was posterior packing, but satisfactory bypass was performed.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room, placed in a supine position, and prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner with Betadine solution.  A longitudinal incision was made after a Betadine-coated drape was placed over the incisional area.  Longitudinal incision was made over each groin initially and carried down to the subcutaneous fat and fascia.  Hemostasis was obtained with electrocautery.  The common deep and superficial femoral arteries were exposed and then these incisions were covered with antibiotic soaked sponges.  Attention was then turned to the abdomen, where a longitudinal incision was made from the pubis xiphoid, carried down subcutaneous fat and fascia.  Hemostasis was obtained with electrocautery.  The abdomen was entered above the umbilicus and then this was extended with care inferiorly as the patient has undergone previous abdominal surgery.  Mild adhesions were lysed.  The omentum was freed.  The small and large intestine were run with no evidence of abnormalities.  The liver and gallbladder were within normal limits.  No abnormalities were noted.  At this point, the Bookwalter retractor was placed.  NG tube was placed in the stomach and placed on suction.  The intestines were gently packed intraabdominally and laterally.  The rest of the peritoneum was then opened.  The aorta was cleared, both proximally and distally.  The left iliac was completely occluded.  The right iliac was to be cleansed.  At this point, 5000 units of aqueous heparin was administered to allow take effect.  The aorta was then clamped below the renal arteries and opened in a longitudinal fashion.  A single lumbar was ligated with #3-0 Prolene.  The inferior mesenteric artery was occluded intraluminally and required no suture closure.  Care was taken to preserve collaterals.  The aorta was measured, and a 16 mm Gore-Tex graft was brought on the field and anastomosed to the proximal aorta using #3-0 Prolene in a running fashion.  Last stitch was tied.  Hemostasis was excellent.  The clamp was gradually removed and additional Prolene was placed in the right posterolateral aspect to obtain better hemostasis.  At this point, strong pulses were present within the graft.  The limbs were vented and irrigated.  Using bimanual technique, the retroperitoneal tunnels were developed immediately on top of the iliac arteries into the groin.  The grafts were then brought through these, care being taken to avoid twisting of the graft.  At this point, the right iliac was then ligated using #0 Vicryl and the clamp was removed.  Hemostasis was excellent.  The right common femoral artery was then clamped proximally and distally, opened with #11 blade extended with Potts scissors.  The graft was _____ and anastomosed to the artery using #5-0 Prolene in a continuous fashion with a stitch _______ running fashion.  Prior to tying the last stitch, the graft and artery were vented and the last stitch was tied.  Flow was initially restored proximally then distally with good results.  Attention was then turned to the left groin and the artery grafts were likewise exposed, cleared proximally and distally.  The artery was opened, extended with a Potts scissors and anastomosis was performed with #5-0 Prolene again with satisfactory hemostasis.  The last stitch was tied.  Strong pulses were present within the artery and graft itself.  At this point, 25 mg of protamine was administered.  The wounds were irrigated with antibiotic solution.  The groins were repacked.  Attention was then returned to the abdomen.  The retroperitoneal area and the anastomotic sites were checked for bleeding and none was present.  The shell of the aorta was closed over the proximal anastomosis and the retroperitoneum was then repaired over the remaining portions of the graft.  The intraabdominal contents were then allowed to resume their normal position.  There was no evidence of ischemia to the large or small bowel.  At this point, the omentum and stomach were repositioned.  The abdominal wall was closed in a running single layer fashion using #1 PDS.  The skin was closed with skin staples.  The groins were again irrigated, closed with #3-0 Vicryl and #4-0 undyed Vicryl and Steri-Strips.  The patient was then taken into the recovery room in satisfactory condition after tolerating the procedure well.  Sponges and instrument counts were correct.  Estimated blood loss 900 cc."

He is for exam under anesthesia and control of hemorrhage at this time.,FINDINGS: , There was an ulcer where most of the polypoid lesion had been excised before.  In a near total fashion the wound had opened and again there was a raw ulcer surface in between the edges of the mucosa.  There were a few discrete sites of mild oozing, which were treated with cautery and #1 suture.  No other obvious bleeding was seen.,TECHNIQUE: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed on the operative table in supine position.  After adequate general anesthesia was induced, the patient was then placed in modified prone position.  His buttocks were taped, prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  The anterior rectal wall was exposed using a Parks anal retractor.  The entire wound was visualized with a few rotations of the retractor and a few sites along the edges were seen to be oozing and were touched up with cautery.  There was one spot in the corner that was oozing and this may have been from simply opening the retractor enough to see well.  This was controlled with a 3-0 Monocryl figure-of-eight suture.  At the completion, there was no bleeding, no oozing, it was completely dry, and we removed our retractor, and the patient was then turned and extubated and taken to the recovery room in stable condition."
28, Pain management sample progress note., Pain Management Progress Note ,"DIAGNOSES:,1.  Cervical dystonia.,2.  Post cervical laminectomy pain syndrome.,Ms. XYZ states that the pain has now shifted to the left side.  She has noticed a marked improvement on the right side, which was subject to a botulinum toxin injection about two weeks ago.  She did not have any side effects on the Botox injection and she feels that her activities of daily living are increased, but she is still on the oxycodone and methadone.  The patient's husband confirms the fact that she is doing a lot better, that she is more active, but there are still issues yet regarding anxiety, depression, and frustration regarding the pain in her neck.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,  The patient is appropriate.  She is well dressed and oriented x3.  She still smells of some cigarette smoke.  Examination of the neck shows excellent reduction in muscle spasm on the right paraspinals, trapezius and splenius capitis muscles.  There are no trigger points felt and her range of motion of the neck is still somewhat guarded, but much improved.  On the left side, however, there is significant muscle spasm with tight bands involving the multifidus muscle with trigger point activity and a lot of tenderness and guarding.  This extends down into the trapezius muscle, but the splenius capitis seems to be not involved.,TREATMENT PLAN:,  After a long discussion with the patient and the husband, we have decided to go ahead and do botulinum toxin injection into the left multifidus/trapezius muscles.  A total of 400 units of Botox is anticipated.  The procedure is being scheduled.  The patient's medications are refilled.  She will continue to see Dr. Berry and continue her therapy with Mary Hotchkinson in Victoria."

Modified Le Fort I osteotomy.,INDICATIONS FOR THE PROCEDURE:, The patient has undergone previous surgical treatment and had a diagnosis of basal cell nevus syndrome.  Currently our plan is to remove the impacted third molar teeth, to remove a cystic lesion left posterior mandible, to remove 4 second bicuspid teeth as requested by her orthodontist, and to weaken and her maxilla to allow expansion by a modified Le Fort osteotomy.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:, The patient was brought into the operating room, placed on the operating table in supine position.  Following treatment under adequate general anesthesia via the orotracheal route, the patient was prepped and draped in a manner consistent with intraoral surgical procedures.  The oral cavity was suctioned, was drained of fluid and a throat pack was placed.  General anesthesia nursing service was notified and which was removed at the end of the procedure.  Lidocaine 1% with epinephrine concentration in 1:100,000 was injected into the labial vestibule of the maxilla bilaterally as well as the lateral areas associated with the extractions sites in lower jaw and the left posterior mandible for a total of 11 mL.  A Bovie electrocautery was utilized to make a vestibular incision, beginning in the second molar region of the maxilla superior to the mucogingival junction extending to the area of the cuspid teeth.  Subperiosteal dissection revealed lateral aspect of the maxilla immediately posterior to the second molar tooth where the third molar tooth was identified and was bony crypt.  Following use of Cerebromaxillary osteotome, elevated, and underwent complete removal of the dental follicle.  Secondly, tooth number 4 was removed.  Tooth number 13 was removed, and the opposite third molar tooth was removed through an identical incision on the opposite side.  Surgeon then utilized a #15 saw to make a horizontal osteotomy through the lateral aspect of the maxilla from the target plates, anteriorly to the area of the buttress region cross the anterior maxilla to a point adjacent to the piriform rim, 5 mm superior to the nasal floor, bilaterally Cerebromaxillary osteotome utilized to separate the maxilla from the target placed posteriorly and a 5 mm Tessier osteotome through a vertical incision anteriorly between roots of teeth numbers 8 and 9.  This resulted in the alternate mobilization of the two halves of the maxilla, or to allow expansion.  These wounds were all irrigated with copious amounts of normal saline and with antibiotic containing solution, closed with 3-0 chromic suture in running fashion for watertight closure.  Attention was directed to the mandible where the left posterior mandible was approached through a lateral vestibular incision overlying the external oblique ridge and brought anteriorly in an old scar.  The surgeons utilized cautery osteotome to identify a cystic lesion associated with the left posterior mandible, which was approximately 1 cm in width and 2.5 to 3 cm in vertical dimension immediately adjacent to the neurovascular bundle.  This wound was then irrigated with copious amounts of normal saline and concentrated solution of clindamycin.  Closed primarily with a 3-0 Vicryl suture in running fashion for a watertight closure.  Teeth number 20 and 29 where removed and 3-0 chromic suture placed.  This concluded the procedure.  All cottonoids and other sponges, throat pack were removed.  No complications were encountered.  The aforementioned cystic lesion was sent with specimen no drains were placed.  The blood loss from this procedure was approximately 100 mL.,The patient was returned over the care of the anesthesia where she was extubated in the operating room, taken from the operating room to the recovery room with stable vital signs and spontaneous respirations."
32," Patient has trouble with walking and balance, with bladder control, and with thinking and memory.", Neurologic Consultation - 2 ,"REASON FOR VISIT:  ,The patient is a 76-year-old man referred for neurological consultation by Dr. X.  The patient is companied to clinic today by his wife and daughter.  He provides a small portion of his history; however, his family provides virtually all of it.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , He has trouble with walking and balance, with bladder control, and with thinking and memory.  When I asked him to provide me detail, he could not tell me much more than the fact that he has trouble with his walking and that he has trouble with his bladder.  He is vaguely aware that he has trouble with his memory.,According to his family, he has had difficulty with his gait for at least three or four years.  At first, they thought it was weakness and because of he was on the ground (for example, gardening) he was not able to get up by himself.  They did try stopping the statin that he was taking at that time, but because there was no improvement over two weeks, they resumed the statin.  As time progressed, he developed more and more difficulty.  He started to shuffle.  He started using a cane about two and a half years ago and has used a walker with wheels in the front since July of 2006.  At this point, he frequently if not always has trouble getting in or out of the seat.  He frequently tends to lean backwards or sideways when sitting.  He frequently if not always has trouble getting in or out a car, always shuffles or scuffs his feet, always has trouble turning or changing direction, always has trouble with uneven surfaces or curbs, and always has to hold on to someone or something when walking.  He has not fallen in the last month.  He did fall earlier, but there seemed to be fewer opportunities for him to fall.  His family has recently purchased a lightweight wheelchair to use if he is traveling long distances.  He has no stairs in his home, however, his family indicates that he would not be able to take stairs.  His handwriting has become smaller and shakier.,In regard to the bladder, he states, ""I wet the bed.""  In talking with his family, it seems as if he has no warning that he needs to empty his bladder.  He was diagnosed with a small bladder tumor in 2005.  This was treated by Dr. Y.  Dr. X does not think that the bladder tumor has anything to do with the patient's urinary incontinence.  The patient has worn a pad or undergarment for at least one to one and a half years.  His wife states that they go through two or three of them per day.  He has been placed on medications; however, they have not helped.,He has no headaches or sensation of head fullness.,In regard to the thinking and memory, at first he seemed forgetful and had trouble with dates.  Now he seems less spontaneous and his family states he seems to have trouble expressing himself.  His wife took over his medications about two years ago.  She stopped his driving about three years ago.  She discovered that his license had been expired for about a year and she was concerned enough at that time that she told him he could drive no more.  Apparently, he did not object.  At this point, he frequently has trouble with memory, orientation, and everyday problems solving at home.  He needs coaching for his daily activities such as reminders to brush his teeth, put on his clothes, and so forth.  He is a retired office machine repairman.  He is currently up and active about 12 hours a day and sleeping or lying down about 12 hours per day.,He has not had PT or OT and has not been treated with medications for Parkinson's disease or Alzheimer's disease.  He has been treated for the bladder.  He has not had lumbar puncture.,Past medical history and review of all 14 systems from the form they completed for this visit that I reviewed with them is negative with the exception that he has had hypertension since 1985, hypercholesterolemia since 1997, and diabetes since 1998.  The bladder tumor was discovered in 2005 and was treated noninvasively.  He has lost weight from about 200 pounds to 180 pounds over the last two or three years.  He had a period of depression in 1999 and was on Prozac for a while, but this was then stopped.  He used to drink a significant amount of alcohol.  This was problematic enough that his wife was concerned.  She states he stopped when she retired and she was at home all day.,SOCIAL HISTORY:  ,He quit smoking in 1968.  His current weight is 183 pounds.  His tallest height is 5 feet 10 inches.,FAMILY HISTORY:  ,His grandfather had arthritis.  His father had Parkinson's disease.  His mother had heart disease and a sister has diabetes.,He does not have a Living Will and indicates he would wish his wife to make decisions for him if he could not make them for himself.,REVIEW OF HYDROCEPHALUS RISK FACTORS: , None.,ALLERGIES: , None.,MEDICATIONS: , Metformin 500 mg three times a day, Lipitor 10 mg per day, lisinopril 20 mg per day, metoprolol 50 mg per day, Uroxatral 10 mg per day, Detrol LA 4 mg per day, and aspirin 81 mg per day.,PHYSICAL EXAM: , On examination today, this is a pleasant 76-year-old man who is guided back from the clinic waiting area walking with his walker.  He is well developed, well nourished, and kempt.,Vital Signs:  His weight is 180 pounds.,Head:  The head is normocephalic and atraumatic.  The head circumference is 59 cm, which is the ,75-90th percentile for an adult man whose height is 178 cm.,Spine:  The spine is straight and not tender.  I can easily palpate the spinous processes.  There is no scoliosis.,Skin:  No neurocutaneous stigmata.,Cardiovascular Examination:  No carotid or vertebral bruits.,Mental Status:  Assessed for orientation, recent and remote memory, attention span, concentration, language, and fund of knowledge.  The Mini-Mental State Exam score was 17/30.  He did not know the year, season, or day of the week nor did he know the building or specialty or the floor.  There was a tendency for perseveration during the evaluation.  He could not copy the diagram of intersecting pentagons.,Cranial Nerve Exam:  No evidence of papilledema.  The pupillary light reflex is intact as are extraocular movements without nystagmus, facial expression and sensation, hearing, head turning, tongue, and palate movement.,Motor Exam:  Normal bulk and strength, but the tone is marked by significant paratonia.  There is no atrophy, fasciculations, or drift.  There is tremulousness of the outstretched hands.,Sensory Exam:  Is difficult to interpret.  Either he does not understand the test or he is mostly guessing.,Cerebellar Exam:  Is intact for finger-to-nose, heel-to-knee, and rapid alternating movement tests.  There is no dysarthria.,Reflexes:  Trace in the arms, 2+ at the knees, and 0 at the ankles.  It is not certain whether there is a Babinski sign or simply withdrawal.,Gait:  Assessed using the Tinetti assessment tool that shows a balance score of 7-10/16 and a gait score of 2-5/12 for a total score of 9-15/28, which is significantly impaired.,REVIEW OF X-RAYS: , I personally reviewed the MRI scan of the brain from December 11, 2007 at Advanced Radiology.  It shows the ventricles are enlarged with a frontal horn span of 5.0 cm.  The 3rd ventricle contour is flat.  The span is enlarged at 12 mm.  The sylvian aqueduct is patent.  There is a pulsation artifact.  The corpus callosum is effaced.  There are extensive T2 signal abnormalities that are confluent in the corona radiata.  There are also scattered T2 abnormalities in the basal ganglia.  There is a suggestion of hippocampal atrophy.  There is also a suggestion of vermian atrophy.,ASSESSMENT: , The patient has a clinical syndrome that raises the question of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus.  His examination today is notable for moderate-to-severe dementia and moderate-to-severe gait impairment.  His MRI scan raises the question of hydrocephalus, however, is also consistent with cerebral small vessel disease.,PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES:,1.  Possible idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (331.5).,2.  Probable cerebral small-vessel disease (290.40 & 438).,3.  Gait impairment (781.2).,4.  Urinary urgency and incontinence (788.33).,5.

Informed consent was obtained. Patient received several sets of drops in his/her XXX eye including Ocuflox, Ocular, and pilocarpine. (S)He was taken to the operating room where monitored anesthetic care was initiated. Retrobulbar anesthesia was then administered to the XXX eye using a 50:50 mixture of 2% plain lidocaine and 0.05% Marcaine. The XXX eye was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile ophthalmic fashion and the microscope was brought in position. A Lieberman lid speculum was used to provide exposure. Vannas scissors and smooth forceps were used to create a 6 mm limbal peritomy superiorly. This was dissected posteriorly with Vannas scissors to produce a fornix based conjunctival flap. Residual episcleral vessels were cauterized with Eraser-tip cautery. Sponges soaked in mitomycin C 0.3 mm per cc were then placed underneath the conjunctival flap and allowed to sit there for 3 minutes checked against the clock. Sponges were removed and area was copiously irrigated with balanced salt solution. A Super blade was then used to fashion a partial thickness limbal based trapezoidal scleral flap. This was dissected anteriorly with a crescent blade to clear cornea. A temporal paracentesis was then made. Scleral flap was lifted and a Super blade was used to enter the anterior chamber. A Kelly-Descemet punch was used to remove a block of limbal tissue. DeWecker scissors were used to perform a surgical iridectomy. The iris was then carefully reposited back into place and the iridectomy was visible through the clear cornea. A scleral flap was then re- approximated back on the bed. One end of the scleral flap was closed with a #10-0 nylon suture in interrupted fashion and the knot was buried. The other end of the scleral flap was closed with #10-0 nylon suture in interrupted fashion and the knot was buried. The anterior chamber was then refilled with balanced salt solution and a small amount of fluid was noted to trickle out of the scleral flap with slow shallowing of the chamber. Therefore it was felt that another #10-0 nylon suture should be placed and it was therefore placed in interrupted fashion half way between each of the end sutures previously placed. The anterior chamber was then again refilled with balanced salt solution and it was noted that there was a small amount of fluid tricking out of the scleral flap and the pressure was felt to be adequate in the anterior chamber. Conjunctiva was then re-approximated to the limbus and closed with #9-0 Vicryl suture on a TG needle at each of the peritomy ends. Then a horizontal mattress style #9-0 Vicryl suture was placed at the center of the conjunctival peritomy. The conjunctival peritomy was checked for any leaks and was noted to be watertight using Weck- cel sponge. The anterior chamber was inflated and there was noted that the superior bleb was well formed. At the end of the case, the pupil was round, the chamber was formed and the pressure was felt to be adequate. Speculum and drapes were carefully removed. Ocuflox and Maxitrol ointment were placed over the eye. Atropine was also placed over the eye. Then an eye patch and eye shield were placed over the eye. The patient was taken to the recovery room in good condition. There were no complications."

Preoperative imaging studies revealed the above-noted abnormalities. After a detailed review of management considerations with the patient and his wife, he was elected to proceed as noted above.,Operative indications, methods, potential benefits, risks and alternatives were reviewed. The patient and his wife expressed understanding and consented to proceed as above.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS:, L4-L5 and L5-S1 disk protrusion with configuration as anticipated from preoperative imaging studies. Pedicle screw placement appeared satisfactory with satisfactory purchase and positioning noted at all sites as well as satisfactory findings upon probing of the pedicular tracts at each site. In addition, all pedicle screws were stimulated with findings of above threshold noted at all sites. Spacer snugness and positioning appeared satisfactory. Electrophysiological monitoring was carried out throughout the procedure and remained stable with no undue changes reported.,DESCRIPTION OF THE OPERATION:, After obtaining proper patient identification and appropriate preoperative informed consent, the patient was taken to the operating room on a hospital stretcher in the supine position. After the induction of satisfactory general endotracheal anesthesia and placement of appropriate monitoring equipment by Anesthesiology as well as placement of electrophysiological monitoring equipment by the Neurology team, the patient was carefully turned to the prone position and placed upon the padded Jackson table with appropriate additional padding placed as needed. The patient's posterior lumbosacral region was thoroughly cleansed and shaved. The patient was then scrubbed, prepped and draped in the usual manner. After local infiltration with 1% lidocaine with 1: 200,000 epinephrine solution, a posterior midline skin incision was made extending from approximately L3 to the inferior aspect of the sacrum. Dissection was continued in the midline to the level of the posterior fascia. Self-retaining retractors were placed and subsequently readjusted as needed. The fascia was opened in the midline, and the standard subperiosteal dissection was then carried out to expose the posterior and posterolateral elements from L3-L4 to the sacrum bilaterally with lateral exposure carried out to the lateral aspect of the transverse processes of L4 and L5 as well as the sacral alae bilaterally. _____ by completing the exposure, pedicle screw fixation was carried out in the following manner. Screws were placed in systematic caudal in a cranial fashion. The pedicle screw entry sites were chosen using standard dorsal landmarks and fluoroscopic guidance as needed. Cortical openings were created at these sites using a small burr. The pedicular tracts were then preliminarily prepared using a Lenke pedicle finder. They were then probed and subsequently tapped employing fluoroscopic guidance as needed. Each site was ""under tapped"" and reprobed with satisfactory findings noted as above. Screws in the following dimensions were placed. 6.5-mm diameter screws were placed at all sites. At S1, 40-mm length screws were placed bilaterally. At L5, 40-mm length screws were placed bilaterally, and at L4, 40-mm length screws were placed bilaterally with findings as noted above. The rod was then contoured to span from the L4 to the S1 screws on the right. The distraction was placed across the L4-L5 interspace, and the connections were temporarily secured. Using a matchstick burr, a trough was then carefully created slightly off the midline of the left lamina extending from its caudal aspect to its more cranial aspect at the foraminal level. This was longitudinally oriented. A transverse trough was similarly carefully created from the cranial point of the longitudinal trough out to the lateral aspect of the pars against the foraminal level that is slightly caudal to the L4 pedicle. This trough was completed to the level of the ligamentum flavum using small angled curettes and Kerrison rongeurs, and this portion of the lamina along with the inferior L4 articular process was then removed as a unit using rongeurs and curettes. The cranial aspect of the left L5 superior articular process was then removed using a small burr and angled curettes and Kerrison rongeurs. A superior laminotomy was performed from the left L5 lamina and flavectomy was then carried out across this region of decompression, working from caudally to cranially and medially to laterally, again using curettes and Kerrison rongeurs under direct visualization. In this manner, the left lateral aspect of the thecal sac passing left L5 spinal nerve and exiting left L4 spinal nerve along with posterolateral aspect of disk space was exposed. Local epidural veins were coagulated with bipolar and divided. Gelfoam was then placed in this area. This process was then repeated in similar fashion; thereby, exposing the posterolateral aspect of the left L5-S1 disk space. As noted, distraction had previously been placed at L4-L5, this was released. Distraction was placed across the L5-S1 interspace. After completing satisfactory exposure as noted, a annulotomy was made in the posterolateral left aspect of the L5-S1 disk space. Intermittent neural retraction was employed with due caution afforded to the neural elements throughout the procedure. The disk space was entered, and diskectomy was carried out in routine fashion using pituitary rongeurs followed by the incremental sized disk space shavers as well as straight and then angled TLIF curettes to prepare the front plate. Herniated portions of the disk were also removed in routine fashion. The diskectomy and endplate preparation were carried out working progressively from the left towards the right aspect of the disk across the midline in routine fashion. After completing this disk space preparation, Gelfoam was again placed. The decompression was assessed and appeared to be satisfactory. The distraction was released, and attention was redirected at L4-L5, where again, distraction was placed and diskectomy and endplate preparation was carried out at this interspace again in similar fashion. After completing the disk space preparation, attention was redirected to L5-S1. Distraction was released at L4-L5 and again, reapplied at L5-S1, incrementally increasing size. Trial spaces were used, and a 10-mm height by 26-mm length spacer was chosen. A medium BMP kit was appropriately reconstituted. A BMP sponge containing morcellated vertebral autograft was then placed into the anterior aspect of the disk space. The spacer was then carefully impacted into position. The distraction was released. The spacer was checked with satisfactory snugness and positioning noted. This process was then repeated in similar fashion at L4-L5, again with placement of a 10-mm height by 26-mm length Capstone spacer, again containing BMP and again with initial placement of a BMP sponge with vertebral autograft anteriorly within the interspace. This spacer was also checked again with satisfactory snugness and positioning noted. The prior placement of the spacers and BMP, the wound was thoroughly irrigated and dried with satisfactory hemostasis noted. Surgicel was placed over the exposed dura and disk space. The distraction was released on the right and compression plates across the L5-S1 and L4-L5 interspaces and the connections fully tightened in routine fashion. The posterolateral elements on the right from L4 to S1 were prepared for fusion in routine fashion, and BMP sponges with supplemental vertebral autograft was placed in the posterolateral fusion bed as well as the vertebral autograft in the dorsal aspect of the L4-L5 and L5-S1 facets on the right in a routine fashion. A left-sided rod was appropriated contoured and placed to span between the L4 to S1 screws. Again compression was placed across the L4-L5 and L5-S1 segments, and these connections were fully secured. Thorough hemostasis was ascertained after checking the construct closely and fluoroscopically. The wound was closed using multiple simple interrupted 0-Vicryl sutures to reapproximate the deep paraspinal musculature in the midline. The superficial paraspinal musculature in posterior fashion was closed in the midline using multiple simple interrupted 0-Vicryl sutures. The suprafascial subcutaneous layers were closed using multiple simple interrupted #0 and 2-0 Vicryl sutures. The skin was then closed using staples. Sterile dressings were then applied and secured in place. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was to the recovery room in satisfactory condition."

Hallux abductovalgus deformity with bunion of the left foot., Scarf Bunionectomy ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Hallux abductovalgus deformity with bunion of the left foot.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Hallux abductovalgus deformity with bunion of the left foot.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Scarf bunionectomy procedure of the first metatarsal of the left foot.,ANESTHESIA:,  IV sedation with local.,HISTORY: , This patient is a 55-year-old female who presents to ABCD preoperative holding area after keeping herself n.p.o., since mid night for surgery for her painful left bunion.  The patient has had increasing pain over time and is having difficulty ambulating and wearing shoes.  The patient has failed to conservative treatment and desires surgical correction at this time.  Risks versus benefits of the procedure have been explained in detail by Dr. X, and consent is available on the chart for review.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  After an IV established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was given preoperatively 600 mg of clindamycin intravenously.  The patient was then taken to the Operating Suite via cart and was placed on the operating table in a supine position and a safety strap was placed across her waist for protection.  Next, a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied over her left ankle with copious amounts of Webril for the patient's protection.  After adequate IV sedation was applied, the patient was given a local injection consisting of 17 cc of 4.5 cc 1% lidocaine plain, 4.5 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain, and 1.0 cc of Solu-Medrol mixture in the standard Mayo block to the left foot.  The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion.  The foot was then elevated, the Esmarch was applied and the tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg.  The foot was then lowered to the operating field.,A sterile stockinet was reflected and the attention was directed to the first metatarsophalangeal joint of the left foot.  After sufficient anesthesia, using a #10 blade a linear incision was made approximately 5 to 6 cm in length over the first metatarsophalangeal joint dorsally, just near to the extensor hallucis longus tendon.  Then using a fresh #15 blade, this incision was deepened through the skin into the subcutaneous layer after all small traversing veins were ligated and cauterized with electrocautery.  A neurovascular bundle was identified and reflected medially.  Laterally the extensor hallucis longus tendon was identified and protected with retraction as well.  Care was then taken to undermine the medial and lateral margins of the first metatarsophalangeal joint carefully.  The first metatarsophalangeal joint capsule was then identified and using a #15 blade, a linear incision made down to the bone through the joint capsule.  The periosteum was reflected and elevated off of its bone and the metatarsal head as well as the base of the proximal phalanx to a small degree.  Noted was a large hypertrophic bone spur on the dorsal medial aspect of the first metatarsal head as well as some small osteophytes along the medial portion of the proximal phalanx.  Care was then taken to reflect and dissect the periosteum off of the shaft of the first metatarsal proximally into the proximal portion of the metatarsal close to the first metatarsocuneiform joint.  The bone cortex was noted to be intact and in good condition.  Following this, using a sagittal saw with a #138 blade, the attention was directed to the medial hypertrophic bone of the first metatarsal head.  In the sagittal plane with the blade angulated from dorsolateral to proximal medial, the medial eminence of bone was resected.  Plantarly it was noted that the tibial sesamoid groove was intact and the sesamoid apparatus was intact as well.  Following this bone cut, 0.45 K-wire was inserted from medial to lateral through the medial portion of the first metatarsal head directed in the dorsal third of the metatarsal head.  Then using the Reese osteotomy guide, the guide was directed from the distal portion of the metatarsal head proximally to the proximal portion of the first metatarsal.  A second 0.45 K-wire was inserted proximally as well.  Following this, using the sagittal saw with the #138 blade a transverse linear osteotomy cut was made through the first metatarsal from medial to lateral.  After reaching the distal as well as the proximal portions of the bone and ensuring that cortex was cut on both the medial as well as lateral side, the Reese osteotomy guide was removed and the dorsal and plantar incision cuts were made.  This began with the dorsal distal cut, which extended from medial to lateral with the dorsal portion of the blade angled proximally about five degrees through the dorsal third of the distal first metatarsal.  Following this, attention was directed proximally and an incision osteotomy cut through the bone was made, directed medially to laterally with the inferior portion of the blade angled distally to transect the cortex of the bone.  Following this, the distal portion of the osteotomy cut was freely movable and was able to be translocated medially.  The head was then slit medially several millimeters until it was noted to be in good position and no chopping was present in the medullary canal of the bone.  Following this, the bone was stabilized using a 0.45 K-wire distally as well as proximally directed from dorsal to planar direction.  Next using the normal AO manner, the distal cortex was drilled from dorsal to plantar with a 2.0 mm drill bit and then over drilled proximally with the cortex using a 2.7 mm drill bit.  The proximal cortex was then _________ and then the drill hole was measured and it was determined to be 18 mm in length from dorsal to plantar cortex.  Then using 2.7 mm tap, the thread holes were placed and using an 18 x 2.7 mm screw ___________ was achieved and good apposition of the bone and tightness were achieved.  Intramedullary sludge was noted to exit from the osteotomy cut.  Following this, attention was directed proximally and the 0.45 K-wire was removed and the holes were predrilled using a 2.0 mm screw then over-drilled using 2.7 mm screw and counter sucked.  Following this, the holes were measured, found to 20 mm in length and the drill hole was tapped using a 2.7 mm tap.  Following this, a 20 mm full threaded screw was inserted and tightened.  Good intramedullary sludge was noted and compression was achieved.  Attention was then directed to the distal screw where it was once again tightened and found to be in good position with good bite.  Following this, range of motion was performed on the first metatarsophalangeal joint and some lateral deviation of the hallux was noted.  Based on this, a lateral release was performed.  The extensor hallucis longus tendon was identified and was transected medially and a linear incision was placed down using a #15 blade into the first interspace.  The incision was then deepened with sharp and blunt dissection and using a curved hemostat, the transverse as well as the oblique fibers of the abductor hallucis tendon were identified and transected.  Care was taken to perform lateral release around the fibular sesamoid through these suspensory ligaments as well as the transverse metatarsal ligament and the collateral ligament.  Upon completion of this, the hallux was noted to be in a rectus position with good alignment.  The area was then flushed and irrigated with copious amounts of sterile saline.  After this, attention was directed back to the medial capsule and a medial capsulorrhaphy was performed and the capsule was closed using #3-0 Vicryl suture.  Subcutaneous tissues were closed using #3-0 and #4-0 Vicryl sutures to close in layers.  The skin was then reapproximated and closed using #5-0 Monocryl suture.  Following this, the incisions were dressed and bandaged in the normal manner using Owen silk, 4x4s, Kling, and Kerlix as well as Coban dressing.  The tourniquet was then dropped with a total tourniquet time of 99 minutes at 250 mmHg.  The patient followed the procedure and the anesthesia well and vascular status was intact as noted by immediate hyperemia to digits one through five of the left foot.  The patient was then transferred back to the cart and escorted on the cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit.  Following this, the patient was given prescription for Vicoprofen total #20 to be taken one every six hours as necessary for moderate to severe pain.  The patient was also given prescription for clindamycin to be taken 300 mg four times a day.  The patient was given surgical shoe and was placed in a posterior sling.  The patient was given crutches and instructed to use them for ambulation.  The patient was instructed to keep her foot iced and elevated and to remain nonweightbearing over the weekend.  The patient will follow up with Dr. X on Tuesday morning at 11'o clock in his Livonia office.  The patient was concerned about any possible allergic reaction to medication and was placed on codeine and antibiotics due to that.  The patient has Dr. X's pager and will contact him over this weekend if she has any problems or complaints or return to Emergency Department if any difficulty should arise.  X-rays were taken and the patient was discharged home upon completion of this."

Left conchal cartilage harvest (CPT 21235).,ANESTHESIA: , General.,INDICATIONS FOR THE PROCEDURE: , This patient is an otherwise healthy male who had a previous nasal fracture.  During his healing, perioperatively he did sustain a hockey puck to the nose resulting in a saddle-nose deformity with septal hematoma.  The patient healed status post rhinoplasty as a result but was left with a persistent saddle-nose dorsal defect.  The patient was consented for the above-stated procedure.  The risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: ,The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The patient did have approximately 12 mL of Lidocaine with epinephrine 1% with 1:100,000 infiltrated into the nasal soft tissues.  In addition to this, cocaine pledgets were placed to assist with hemostasis.,At this point, attention was turned to the left ear.  Approximately 3 mL of 1% Lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine was infiltrated into the subcutaneous tissues of the conchal bulb.  Betadine was utilized for preparation.  A 15 blade was used to incise along the posterior conchal area and a Freer elevator was utilized to lift the soft tissues off the conchal cartilage in a submucoperichondrial plane.  I then completed this along the posterior aspect of the conchal cartilage, was transected in the concha cavum and concha cymba, both were harvested.  These were placed aside in saline.  Hemostasis was obtained with bipolar electrocauterization.  Bovie electrocauterization was also employed as needed.  The entire length of the wound was then closed with 5-0 plain running locking suture.  The patient then had a Telfa placed both anterior and posterior to the conchal defect and placed in a sandwich dressing utilizing a 2-0 Prolene suture.  Antibiotic ointment was applied generously.,Next, attention was turned to opening and lifting the soft tissues of the nose.  A typical external columella inverted V gull-wing incision was placed on the columella and trailed into a marginal incision.  The soft tissues of the nose were then elevated using curved sharp scissors and Metzenbaums.  Soft tissues were elevated over the lower lateral cartilages, upper lateral cartilages onto the nasal dorsum.  At this point, attention was turned to osteotomies and examination of the external cartilages.,The patient did have very broad lower lateral cartilages leading to a bulbous tip.  The lower lateral cartilages were trimmed in a symmetrical fashion leaving at least 8 mm of lower lateral cartilage bilaterally along the lateral aspect.  Having completed this, the patient had medial and lateral osteotomies performed with a 2-mm osteotome.  These were done transmucosally after elevating the tract using a Cottle elevator.  Direct hemostasis pressure was applied to assist with bruising.,Next, attention was turned to tip mechanisms.  The patient had a series of double-dome sutures placed into the nasal tip.  Then, 5-0 Dexon was employed for intradomal suturing, 5-0 clear Prolene was used for interdomal suturing.  Having completed this, a 5-0 clear Prolene alar spanning suture was employed to narrow the superior tip area.,Next, attention was turned to dorsal augmentation.  A Gore-Tex small implant had been selected, previously incised.  This was taken to the back table and carved under sterile conditions.  The patient then had the implant placed into the super-tip area to assist with support of the nasal dorsum.  It was placed into a precise pocket and remained in the midline.,Next, attention was turned to performing a columella strut.  The cartilage from the concha was shaped into a strut and placed into a precision pocket between the medial footplate of the lower lateral cartilage.  This was fixed into position utilizing a 5-0 Dexon suture.,Having completed placement of all augmentation grafts, the patient was examined for hemostasis.  The external columella inverted gull-wing incision along the nasal tip was closed with a series of interrupted everting 6-0 black nylon sutures.  The entire marginal incisions for cosmetic rhinoplasty were closed utilizing a series of 5-0 plain interrupted sutures.,At the termination of the case, the ear was inspected and the position of the conchal cartilage harvest was hemostatic.  There was no evidence of hematoma, and the patient had a series of brown Steri-Strips and Aquaplast cast placed over the nasal dorsum.  The inner nasal area was then examined at the termination of the case and it seemed to be hemostatic as well.,The patient was transferred to the PACU in stable condition.  He was charged to home on antibiotics to prevent infection both from the left ear conchal cartilage harvest and also the Gore-Tex implant area.  He was asked to follow up in 4 days for removal of the bolster overlying the conchal cartilage harvest."

She saw her dentist in Sacaton before Thanksgiving who placed her on antibiotics and told her to return to the clinic for multiple teeth extractions.  The patient neglected to return to the dentist until this weekend for IV antibiotics and definitive treatment.  She noticed on Friday that her face was starting to swell up a little bit and it progressively got worse.  The patient was admitted to the hospital on Monday for IV antibiotics.  Oral surgery was consulted today to aid in the management of the increased facial swelling and tooth pain.  The patient was worked up preoperatively by anesthesia and Oromaxillary Facial Surgery.  It was determined that she would benefit from being having multiple teeth removed and drainage of the facial abscess under general anesthesia.  Risks, benefits, and alternatives of treatment were thoroughly discussed with the patient and consent was obtained.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:,  The patient was taken to the operating room and laid on the operating room table on supine fashion.  ASA monitors were attached as stated.  General anesthesia was induced with IV anesthetic and maintained with a nasal endotracheal intubation and inhalation of anesthetics.  The patient was prepped and draped in usual oromaxillary facial surgery fashion.,An 18-gauze needle of 20 mL syringe was used to aspirate the pus out of the right buccal space.  This pus was then cultured and sent to micro lab for cultures and sensitivities.  Approximately 7 mL of 1% lidocaine with 1:1000 epinephrine was injected in the maxillary vestibule and palate.  After waiting appropriate time for local anesthesia to take affect a moist latex sponge was placed in the posterior oropharynx to throat pack throughout the case.  Mouth rinse was then poured into the oral cavity.  The mucosa was scrubbed with a tooth brush and peridex was evacuated with suction.  Using a #15 blade a clavicular incision from tooth #5 back to 1 with tuberosity release was performed.,A full thickness mucoperiosteal flap was developed and approximately 6 mL of pus was instantly drained from the buccal space.  It was noted on exam that the tooth #1 was fractured off to the gum line with gross decay.  Tooth #2, 3, 4, and 5 had pus leaking from the clavicular epithelium and had rampant decay on tooth #2 and 3 and some mobility on teeth #4 and 5.  It was decided that teeth #1 through 5 would be surgically removed to ensure that all potential teeth causing the abscess were removed.  Using a rongeur both buccal bone and the tooth 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 were surgically removed.  The extraction sites were curetted with curettes and the bone was smoothed with the rongeur and the bone file.  Dissection was then carried further up in the canine space and the face was palpated extra orally from the temporalis muscle down to the infraorbital rim and more pus was expressed.  This site was then irrigated with copious amounts of sterile water.  There was still noted to be induration in the buccal mucosa so #15 blade was used anterior to Stensen duct.  A 2 cm incision was made and using a Hemostat blunt dissection in to the buccal mucosa was performed.  A little-to-no pus was received.  Using a half-inch Penrose the drain was placed up on the anterior border of the maxilla and zygoma and sutured in place with 2-0 Ethilon suture.  Remainder of the flap was left open to drain.  Further examination of the floor of mouth was soft.  The lateral pharynx was nonindurated or swollen.  At this point, the throat pack was removed and OG tube was placed and the stomach contents were evacuated.  The procedure was then determined to be over.  The patient was extubated, breathing spontaneously, and transferred to the PACU in excellent condition."

She has failed conservative measures and sought operative intervention for relief of her symptoms.  For details of workup, please see the dictated operative report.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  ,Appropriate informed consent was obtained and the patient was taken to the operating room and placed under general anesthetic.  She was placed in a position of comfort on the operating table with all bony prominences and soft tissues well padded and protected.  Second check was made prior to prepping and draping.  Following this, we did needle localization with reviews of AP and lateral multiple times to make sure we had the T8-T9 level.  We then made an approach through a midline incision and came out over the pars.  We dissected down carefully to identify the pars.  We then went on the outside of the pars and identified the foramen and then we took another series of x-rays to confirm the T8-T9 level.  We did this under live fluoroscopy.  We confirmed T8-T9 and then went ahead and took a Midas Rex and removed the superior portion of the pedicle overlying the outside of the disc and then worked our way downward removing portion of the transverse process as well.  We found the edge of the disc and then worked our way and we were able to remove some of the disc material but then decided to go ahead and take down the pars.  The pars was then drilled out.  We identified the disc even further and found the disc herniation material that was under the spinal cord.  We then took a combination of small pituitaries and removed the disc material without difficulty.  Once we had disc material out, we went ahead and made a small cruciate incision in the disc space and entered the disc space in earnest removing more disc material making sure there is nothing free to herniate further.  Once we had done that, we inspected up by the nerve root, found some more disc material there and removed that as well.  We could trace the nerve root out freely and easily.  We made sure there was no evidence of further disc material.  We used an Epstein curette and placed a nerve hook under the nerve root.  The Epstein curette removed some more disc material.  Once we had done this, we were satisfied with the decompression.  We irrigated the wound copiously to make sure there is no further disc material and then ready for closure.  We did place some steroid over the nerve root and readied for closure.  Hemostasis was meticulous.  The wound was closed with #1 Vicryl suture for the fascial layer, 2 Vicryl suture for the skin, and Monocryl and Steri-Strips applied.  Dressing was applied.  The patient was awoken from anesthesia and taken to the recovery room in stable condition.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  150 mL.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,DISPOSITION:,  To PACU in stable condition having tolerated the procedure well, to mobilize routinely when she is comfortable to go to her home."

After induction of IV sedation the left hand was anesthetized suitable for carpal tunnel release; 10 cc of a mixture of 1% Xylocaine and 0.5% Marcaine was injected in the distal forearm and proximal palm suitable for carpal tunnel surgery.  Routine prep and drape was employed.  Arm was exsanguinated by means of elevation of Esmarch elastic tourniquet and tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg pressure.  Hand was positioned palm up in the lead hand-holder.  A short curvilinear incision about the base of the thenar eminence was made.  Skin was sharply incised.  Sharp dissection was carried down to the transverse carpal ligament and this was carefully incised longitudinally along its ulnar margin.  Care was taken to divide the entire length of the transverse retinaculum including its distal insertion into deep palmar fascia in the midpalm.  Proximally the antebrachial fascia was released for a distance of 2-3 cm proximal to the wrist crease to insure complete decompression of the median nerve.  Retinacular flap was retracted radially to expose the contents of the carpal canal.  Median nerve was identified, seen to be locally compressed with moderate erythema and mild narrowing.  Locally adherent tenosynovium was present and this was carefully dissected free.  Additional tenosynovium was dissected from the flexor tendons, individually stripping and peeling each tendon in sequential order so as to debulk the contents of the carpal canal.  Epineurotomy and partial epineurectomy were carried out on the nerve in the area of mild constriction to relieve local external scarring of the epineurium.  When this was complete retinacular flap was laid loosely in place over the contents of the carpal canal and skin only was closed with interrupted 5-0 nylon horizontal mattress sutures.  A syringe with 3 cc of Kenalog-10 and 3 cc of 1% Xylocaine using a 25 gauge short needle was then selected; 1 cc of this mixture was injected into the third finger A1 and A2 pulley tendon sheaths using standard trigger finger injection technique; 1 cc was injected into the fourth finger A1/A2 pulley tendon sheath using standard tendon sheath injection technique; 1 cc was injected into the Dupuytren's nodule in the midpalm to relieve local discomfort.  Routine postoperative hand dressing with well-padded, well-molded volar plaster splint and lightly compressive Ace wrap was applied.  Tourniquet was deflated.  Good vascular color and capillary refill were seen to return to the tips of all digits.  Patient discharged to the ambulatory recovery area and from there discharged home.  Discharge medication is Darvocet-N 100, 30 tablets, one to two PO q.4h. p.r.n.  Patient asked to begin gentle active flexion, extension and passive nerve glide exercises beginning 24-48 hours after surgery.  She was asked to keep the dressings clean, dry and intact and follow up in my office."

Advancement flap closure, with total undermined area 18 centimeters by 16 centimeters (CPT 14300).,ANESTHESIA:,  General endotracheal anesthesia.,INDICATIONS:  ,This is an 81-year-old male who has a large exophytic 7cm lesion of the anterior midline scalp which is biopsy-positive for skin malignancy, specifically, squamous call carcinoma.  This appears to be affixed to the underlying scalp.,PLAN: , Radical resection with frozen sections to clear margins thereafter, with planned reconstruction.,CONSENT:,  I have discussed with the patient the possible risks of bleeding, infection, renal problems, scar formation, injury to muscle, nerves, and possible need for additional surgery with possible recurrence of the patient's carcinoma, with review of detailed informed consent with the patient, who understood, and wished to proceed.,FINDINGS: , The patient had a 7cm large exophytic lesion which appeared to be invasive into the superficial table of the skull.  The final periosteal margin which centrally appeared was positive for carcinoma.  The final margins peripherally were all negative.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the operating room and there was placed supine on the operating room table.,General endotracheal anesthesia was administered after endotracheal tube intubation was performed by the Anesthesia Service personnel.  The patient was thereafter prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner using Betadine Scrub and Betadine paint.  Thereafter, the local anesthesia was injected into the area around the tumor.  A **** type excision was planned down to the periosteum.  A supraperiosteal radical resection was performed.,It was obvious that there was tumor at the deep margin, involving the periosteum.  The edges were marked along the four quadrants, at the 12 o'clock, 3 o'clock, 6 o'clock, and the 9 o'clock positions, and these were sent for frozen section evaluation.  Frozen section revealed positive margins at one end of the resection.  Therefore, an additional circumferential resection was performed and the final margins were all negative.,Following completion, the deep periosteal margin was resected.  The circumferential periosteal margins were noted to be negative; however, centrally, there was a small area which showed tumor eroding into the superficial cortex of the skull.  Therefore, the Midas Rex drill was utilized to resect approximately 1-2 mm of the superficial cortex of the bone at the area where the positive margin was located.  Healthy bone was obtained; however, it did not enter the diploic or marrow-containing bone in the area.  Therefore, no bong margin was taken.  However, at the end of the procedure, it did not appear that the residual bone had any residual changes consistent with carcinoma.,Following completion of the bony resection, the area was irrigated with copious amounts of saline.  Thereafter, advancement flaps were created, both on the left and the right side of the scalp, with the total undermined area being approximately 18cm by 16cm.  The galea was incised in multiple areas, to provide for additional mobilization of the tissue.  The tissue was closed under tension with 3-0 Vicryl suture deep in the galea and surgical staples superficially.,The patient was awakened from anesthetic, was extubated and was taken to the recovery room in stable condition.,DISPOSITION:,  The patient was discharged to home with antibiotics and analgesics, to follow-up in approximately one week.,NOTE: , The final margins of both periosteal, as well as skin were negative circumferentially, around the tumor.  The only positive margin was deep, which was a periosteal margin and bone underlying it was partially resected, as was indicated above."

He sustained a blunt trauma to his ribs resulting in multiple fractures and presumably also struck his mandible resulting in the above-mentioned fracture.  He was admitted to hospital in Harleton, Texas, where his initial evaluation showed the rib fractures have also showed a nodule on his right upper lobe as well as a mediastinal mass.  His mandible fracture was not noted initially.  The patient also has a history of prostate cancer and a renal cell carcinoma.  The patient at that point underwent a bronchoscopy with a biopsy of the mediastinal mass and the results of that biopsy are still pending.  The patient later saw a local oral surgeon.  He diagnosed his mandible fracture and advised him to seek treatment in Houston.  He presented to my office for evaluation on January 18, 2010, and he was found to have an extremely atrophic mandible with a fracture in the left parasymphysis region involving a failed dental implant, which had been placed approximately 15 years ago.  The patient had significant discomfort and could eat foods and drink fluids with difficulty.  Due to the nature of his fracture and the complex medical history, he was sent to the hospital for admission and following cardiac clearance, he was scheduled for surgery today.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the operating room, and placed in a supine position.  Following a nasal intubation and induction of general anesthesia, the surgeon then scrubbed, gowned, and gloved in the normal sterile fashion.  The patient was then prepped and draped in a manner consistent with sterile procedures.  A marking pen was first used to outline the incision in the submental region and it was extended from the left mandibular body to the right mandibular body region, approximately 1.5 cm medial to the inferior border of the mandible.  A 1 mL of lidocaine 1% with 1:100,000 epinephrine was then infiltrated along the incision and then a 15-blade was used to incise through the skin and subcutaneous tissue.  A combination of sharp and blunt dissection was then used to carry the dissection superiorly to the inferior border of the mandible.  Electrocautery as well as 4.0 silk ties were used for hemostasis.  A 15-blade was then used to incise the periosteum along the inferior border of the mandible and it was reflected exposing the mandible as well as the fracture site.  The fracture site was slightly distracted allowing access to the dental implant within the bone and it was easily removed from the wound.  Cultures of this site were also obtained and then the granulation tissue from the wound was also curetted free of the wound and sent for a histologic diagnosis.  Manipulation of the mandible was then used to achieve an anatomic reduction and then an 11-hole Synthes reconstruction plate was then used to stand on the fracture site.  Since there was an area of weakness in the right parasymphysis region, in the location of another dental implant, the bone plate was extended posterior to that site.  When the plate was adapted to the mandible, it was then secured to the bone with 9 screws, each being 2 mm in diameter and each screw was placed bicortically.  All the screws were also locking screws.  Following placement of the screws, there was felt to be excellent stability of the fracture, so the wound was irrigated with a copious amount of normal saline.  The incision was closed in multiple layers with 4.0 Vicryl in the muscular and subcutaneous layers and 5.0 nylon in the skin.  A sterile dressing was then placed over the incision.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the recovery room with spontaneous respirations and stable vital signs.  Estimated blood loss is 125 mL."

Note that previously the patient was found to have some baseline dementia, although slight.  The patient was seen and evaluated by the neurology team, who cleared the patient for surgery.  The patient was taken to the operating room and general endotracheal anesthesia was administered.  The abdomen was prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  We first began our dissection by using a #10-blade scalpel to incise the skin over the femoral artery in the groin bilaterally.  Dissection was carried down to the level of the femoral vessels using Bovie electrocautery.  The common femoral, superficial femoral, and profunda femoris arteries were encircled and dissected out peripherally.  Vessel loops were placed around the aforementioned arteries.  After doing so, we turned our attention to beginning our abdominal dissection.  We used a #10-blade scalpel to make a midline laparotomy incision.  Dissection was carried down to the level of the fascia using Bovie electrocautery.  The abdomen was opened and an Omni retractor was positioned.  The aorta was dissected out in the abdomen.  The left femoral vein was identified.  There was a nicely clampable portion of aorta visible.  We, as mentioned, placed our Omni retractor and then turned our attention to performing our anastomosis.  Full-dose heparin was given.  Next, vascular clamps were applied to the iliac vessels as well as to the proximal aorta just below the renal vessels.  A #11-blade scalpel was used to make an arteriotomy in the aorta, which was lengthened both proximally and distally using Potts scissors.  We then beveled our proximal graft and constructed an end graft-to-side artery anastomosis using 3-0 Prolene in a running fashion.  Upon completion of our anastomosis, we flushed our graft and noted there was no evidence of a leak from the newly constructed anastomosis.  We then created our tunnels over the iliac vessels.  We pulled the distal limbs over our ABF graft into the groin.  We then proceeded to perform our right anastomosis first.  We applied vascular clamps on the proximal common femoral, profunda, and superficial femoral arteries.  We incised the common femoral artery and lengthened our arteriotomy in the vessel both proximally and distally.  We then footed the graft down onto the common femoral artery to the level of the SFA and constructed our anastomosis using 6-0 Prolene in a running fashion.  Upon completion of our anastomosis, we flushed the common femoral, SFA, and profunda femoris arteries.  We then removed our clamp.  We opened the limb more proximally in the abdomen on the right side.  We then turned our attention to the left side and similarly placed our vascular clamps.  We used a #11-blade scalpel to make an arteriotomy in the vessel.  We then lengthened our arteriotomy both proximally and distally again onto the SFA.  We constructed a footed end graft-to-side artery anastomosis using 6-0 Prolene in a running fashion.  Upon completion of our anastomosis, we opened our clamps.  There was no noticeable leak from the newly constructed anastomosis.  We checked our proximal graft to aortic anastomosis, which was noted to be in good condition.  We then gave full-dose protamine.  We closed the peritoneum over the graft with 4-0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  The abdomen was closed with #1 nylon in a running fashion.  The skin was closed with subcuticular 4-0 Monocryl in a running subcuticular fashion.  The instrument and sponge count was correct at end of case.  Patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the intensive care unit in good condition."

His bilateral lower extremities were placed under traction on the Hana table.  His right leg was placed first.  The traction post was left line, and the left leg was placed in traction.  Sterile Hibiclens and alcohol prep and drape were then undertaken.  A fluoroscopic localization was undertaken.  Gentle traction was applied.  Narrow arthrographic effect was obtained.  Following this, the ProTrac portal was made under the fluoro visualization, and then, a direct anterolateral portal made and a femoral neck portal made under direct visualization.  The diagnostic arthroscopy showed the articular surface to be intact with a moderate anterior lip articular cartilage delamination injury that propagated into the acetabulum.  For this reason, the acetabular articular cartilage was taken down and stabilized.  This necessitated takedown of the anterior lip of the acetabulum and subsequent acetabular osteoplasty debridement with associated labral repair.  The labrum was repaired using absorbable Smith & Nephew anchors with a sliding SMC knot.  After stabilization of the labrum and the acetabulum, the ligamentum teres was assessed and noted to be stable.  The remnant articular surface of the femoral artery and acetabulum was stable.  The posterior leg was stable.  The traction was left half off, and the anterolateral aspect of the head and neck junction was identified.  A stable femoral neck decompression was accomplished starting laterally and proceeding anteriorly.  This terminated with the hip coming out of traction and indeterminable flexion.  A combination of burs and shavers was utilized to perform a stable femoral neck osteoplasty decompression.  The decompression was completed with thorough irrigation of the hip.  The cannula was removed, and the portals were closed using interrupted nylon.  The patient was placed into a sterile bandage and anesthetized intraarticularly with 10 mL of ropivacaine subcutaneously with 20 mL of ropivacaine and at this point was taken to the recovery room.  He tolerated the procedure very well with no signs of complications."

The right anterior chest and supraclavicular fossa area, neck, and left side of chest were prepped with Betadine and draped in a sterile fashion.", Ash Split Venous Port ,"ASH SPLIT VENOUS PORT,PROCEDURE DETAILS:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in supine position and monitored anesthesia care provided by the anesthetist.  The right anterior chest and supraclavicular fossa area, neck, and left side of chest were prepped with Betadine and draped in a sterile fashion.  Xylocaine 1% was infiltrated in the supraclavicular area and anterior chest along the planned course of the catheter.  The patient was placed into Trendelenburg position.,The right internal jugular vein was accessed by a supraclavicular 19-gauge, thin-walled needle as demonstrated by easy withdrawal of venous blood on the first pass of the needle.  Under fluoroscopic control, a J-wire was advanced into the right atrium.  The needle was removed and the skin puncture site enlarged to about 8 mm with the scalpel.  A second incision was made 5 cm inferior to the right midclavicular line, through which an Ash split catheter was advanced, using the tunneling rod, in a gently curving pass to exit the skin of the neck incision.  The tunneling needle was removed and the catheter split up to the marker as indicated in the recommended use of the catheter.,Sequential dilators were advanced over the J-wire under fluoroscopic control to dilate the subcutaneous tunnel followed by advancement of a dilator and sheath into the right superior vena cava under fluoroscopic control.  The dilator and wire were removed, leaving the sheath in position, through which a double-lumen catheter was advanced into the central venous system.  The sheath was peeled away, leaving the catheter into position.  Each port of the catheter was flushed with dilute heparinized saline.,The patient was returned to the flat position.  The catheter was secured to the skin of the anterior chest using 2-0 Ethilon suture placed through the suture ""wings."",The neck incision was closed with 3-0 Vicryl subcuticular closure and pressure dressing applied.  Fluoroscopic examination of the chest revealed no evidence of pneumothorax upon completion of the procedure and the catheter was in excellent position.,The patient was returned to the recovery room for postoperative care."

The patient has been informed that more than one procedure may be necessary to achieve the satisfactory results.,INDICATION:,  This patient has failed extended conservative care of condition/dysfunction by means of aggressive physical medical and pharmacological intervention.,COMMENTS: , This patient understands the essence of the diagnosis and the reasons for the MUA- The associated risks of the procedure, including anesthesia complications, fracture, vascular accidents, disc herniation and post-procedure discomfort, were thoroughly discussed with the patient.  Alternatives to the procedure, including the course of the condition without MUA, were discussed.  The patient understands the chances of success from undergoing MUA and that no guarantees are made or implied regarding outcome.  The patient has given both verbal and written informed consent for the listed procedure.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was draped in the appropriate gowning and accompanied to the operative area.  Following their sacral block injection, they were asked to lie supine on the operative table and they were placed on the appropriate monitors for this procedure.  When the patient and I were ready, the anesthesiologist administered the appropriate medications to assist the patient into the twilight sedation using medication which allows the stretching, mobilization, and adjustments necessary for the completion of the outcome I desired.,THORACIC SPINE: , With the patient in the supine position on the operative table, the upper extremities were flexed at the elbow and crossed over the patient's chest to achieve maximum traction to the patient's thoracic spine.  The first assistant held the patient's arms in the proper position and assisted in rolling the patient for the adjusting procedure.  With the help of the first assist, the patient was rolled to their right side, selection was made for the contact point and the patient was rolled back over the doctor's hand.  The elastic barrier of resistance was found, and a low velocity thrust was achieved using a specific closed reduction anterior to posterior/superior manipulative procedure.  The procedure was completed at the level of TI-TI2.  Cavitation was achieved.,LUMBAR SPINE/SACRO-ILIAC JOINTS:,  With the patient supine on the procedure table, the primary physician addressed the patient's lower extremities which were elevated alternatively in a straight leg raising manner to approximately 90 degrees from the horizontal.  Linear force was used to increase the hip flexion gradually during this maneuver.  Simultaneously, the first assist physician applied a myofascial release technique to the calf and posterior thigh musculature.  Each lower extremity was independently bent at the knee and tractioned cephalad in a neutral sagittal plane, lateral oblique cephalad traction, and medial oblique cephalad traction maneuver.  The primary physician then approximated the opposite single knee from his position from neutral to medial slightly beyond the elastic barrier of resistance. (a piriformis myofascial release was accomplished at this time).  This was repeated with the opposite lower extremity.  Following this, a Patrick-Fabere maneuver was performed up to and slightly beyond the elastic barrier of resistance.,With the assisting physician stabling the pelvis and femoral head (as necessary), the primary physician extended the right lower extremity in the sagittal plane, and while applying controlled traction gradually stretched the para-articular holding elements of the right hip by means gradually describing an approximately 30-35 degree horizontal arc.  The lower extremity was then tractioned, and straight caudal and internal rotation was accomplished.  Using traction, the lower extremity was gradually stretched into a horizontal arch to approximately 30 degrees.  This procedure was then repeated using external rotation to stretch the para-articular holding elements of the hips bilaterally.  These procedures were then repeated on the opposite lower extremity.,By approximating the patient's knees to the abdomen in a knee-chest fashion (ankles crossed), the lumbo-pelvic musculature was stretched in the sagittal plane, by both the primary and first assist, contacting the base of the sacrum and raising the lower torso cephalad, resulting in passive flexion of the entire lumbar spine and its holding elements beyond the elastic barrier of resistance"
57," The patient with recurrent nongranulomatous anterior iritis and most recently, pain in  left eye associated with headache and photophobia.", Uveitis ,"PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Significant for GERD, history of iron deficiency anemia, and asthma for which she takes an inhaler.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  Positive for only for left knee arthritis.  She has no exposure to tuberculosis or syphilis, she has no mouth or genital ulcers.  She has no skin rashes.  She has no connective tissue disorders.,PAST OCULAR HISTORY: , Significant for cataract and glaucoma surgery of the right eye.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , On examination, visual acuity measures hand motions on the right and 20/25 in the left.  There is an afferent pupillary defect on the right.  On examination, there is a right hypertropia.  There is dense anterior chamber inflammation on the right eye with a stagnant aqueous.  There is either neovascularization on the iris or reactive iris vessels, it is difficult to discern.  This seems to be complete iris synechia to the anterior lens capsule.  There is a posterior chamber intraocular lens with an inflammatory debris on the anterior surface.  The anterior chamber appears narrow.  On the left, there is also dense inflammation at 4+ cell.  There is 1+ nuclear sclerosis.  Dilated fundus examination cannot be performed on the right secondary to intense inflammation.  On the left, there is no evidence of active posterior uveitis.  There is some inferior vitreous debris.,ASSESSMENT/PLAN:,  Chronic bilateral recurrent nongranulomatous diffuse uveitis.  Currently, there is very severe right eye inflammation and severe left eye.  I discussed at length with the patient that this will likely take an oral steroid to quite her down.  Since she has only one seeing eye, I am anxious to obtain a decreased inflammation as soon as possible.  She has been on oral steroids in the past.  We also discussed, considering the aggressive recurrent nature of this process, it is likely we will have to consider a steroid sparing agent to maintain longer term control of this recurrent process so that we do not use visual acuity in the left.  I anticipate we will likely start methotrexate in the near future.  In this acute phase, I have recommended oral steroids at a dose of 60 mg a day, hourly topical Pred Forte as well as atropine sulfate.  We will watch her closely in clinic.  I am sending a copy of this dictation to her primary care doctor, she said she has had a negative HLA-B27, rheumatoid factor, and ANA in the past.  At this stage, to be thorough I would ask Dr. X to assist us in repeating her chest x-ray, PPD if not current, and an RPR.  Additionally, in anticipation of need for methotrexate, it would be helpful to have a full liver function profile as well as hepatitis B and hepatitis C."
58, CT of abdomen with and without contrast.  CT-guided needle placement biopsy., CT-Guided Needle Placement Biopsy ,"EXAM: , CT of abdomen with and without contrast.  CT-guided needle placement biopsy.,HISTORY: , Left renal mass.,TECHNIQUE: , Pre and postcontrast enhanced images were acquired through the kidneys.,FINDINGS: , Comparison made to the prior MRI.  There is re-demonstration of multiple bilateral cystic renal lesions.  Several of these demonstrate high attenuation in the precontrast phase of the exam suggesting that they are hemorrhagic cysts.  There was however one cyst seen in the lower pole of the left kidney, which demonstrated apparent enhancement from 30 to 70 Hounsfield units post contrast administration.  This measured approximately 1.4 x 1.3 cm to the exophytic half of the lower pole.  No other enhancing renal masses were seen.  The visualized liver, spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands were unremarkable.  There are changes of cholecystectomy.  Mild prominence of the common bile duct is likely secondary to cholecystectomy.  There is no abdominal lymphadenopathy, masses, fluid collection, or ascites.,Lung bases are clear.  No acute bony pathology was noted.,IMPRESSION: , Solitary apparently enhancing left renal mass in the lower pole as described.  Renal cell carcinoma cannot be excluded.,CT-GUIDED NEEDLE BIOPSY, LEFT KIDNEY MASS: , Following discussion of risks, benefits, and alternatives, the patient wished to proceed with CT-guided biopsy of left renal lesion.  The patient was placed in the decubitus position.  The region overlying the left renal mass of note was marked.  Area was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  Local anesthesia was achieved with approximately 8 mL of 1% lidocaine with bicarbonate.  The Versed and fentanyl were given to achieve conscious sedation.  Utilizing an 18 x 15 gauge coaxial system, 3 core biopsies were obtained through the mass in question, and sent to pathology for analysis.  Following procedure, scans through the region demonstrate a small subcutaneous hematoma in the region of the superficial anesthesia.  No perinephric fluid/hematoma was identified.  The patient tolerated the procedure without immediate complications.,IMPRESSION: , Three core biopsies through the region of the left renal tumor as described."

60, Right argon laser assisted stapedectomy.  Bilateral conductive hearing losses with right stapedial fixation secondary to otosclerosis., Stapedectomy - Argon Lasor Assisted ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Bilateral progressive conductive hearing losses with probable otosclerosis.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Bilateral conductive hearing losses with right stapedial fixation secondary to otosclerosis.,OPERATION PERFORMED: , Right argon laser assisted stapedectomy.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room.  Endotracheal intubation carried out by Dr. X. The patient's right ear was carefully prepped and then draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Slow infiltration of the external canal accomplished with 1% Xylocaine with epinephrine.  The earlobe was also infiltrated with the same solution.  A limited incision was made in the earlobe harvesting a small bit of fat from the earlobe that was diced and the donor site closed with interrupted sutures of 5-0 nylon.  This could later be removed in bishop.  A reinspection of the ear canal was accomplished.  A 65 Beaver blade was used to make incision both at 12 o'clock and at 6 o'clock.  Jordan round knife was used to incise the tympanomeatal flap with an adequate cuff for later reapproximation.  Elevation was carried down to the fibrous annulus.  An annulus elevator was used to complete the elevation beneath the annular ligament.  The tympanic membrane and the associated flap rotated anteriorly exposing the ossicular chain.  Palpation of the malleus revealed good mobility of both it and incus, but no movement of the stapes was identified.  Palpation with a fine curved needle on the stapes itself revealed no movement.  A house curette was used to takedown portions of the scutum with extreme care to avoid any inadvertent trauma to the chorda tympani.  The nerve was later hydrated with a small curved needle and an additional fluid to try to avoid inadvertent desiccation of it as well.  The self-retaining speculum holder was used to get secure visibility and argon laser then used to create rosette on the posterior cruse.  The stapes superstructure anteriorly was mobilized with a right angle hook at the incostapedial joint and the superstructure could then be downfractured.  The fenestration created in the footplate was nearly perfect for placement of the piston and therefore additional laser vaporization was not required in this particular situation.  A small bit of additional footplate was removed with a right angle hook to accommodate the 0.6 mm piston.  The measuring device was used and a 4.25 mm slim shaft wire Teflon piston chosen.  It was placed in the middle ear atraumatically with a small alligator forceps and was directed towards the fenestration in the footplate.  The hook was placed over the incus and measurement appeared to be appropriate.  A downbiting crimper was then used to complete the attachment of the prosthesis to the incus.  Prosthesis is once again checked for location and centering and appeared to be in ideal position.  Small pledgets of fat were placed around the perimeter of the piston in an attempt to avoid any postoperative drainage of perilymph.  A small pledget of fat was also placed on the top of the incudo-prosthesis junction.  The mobility appeared excellent.  The flap was placed back in its normal anatomic position.  The external canal packed with small pledgets of Gelfoam and antibiotic ointment.  She was then awakened and taken to the recovery room in a stable condition with discharge anticipated later this day to Bishop.  Sutures will be out in a week and a recheck in Reno in four to five weeks from now."
61, Squamous cell carcinoma of right temporal bone/middle ear space.  Right temporal bone resection; rectus abdominis myocutaneous free flap for reconstruction of skull base defect; right selective neck dissection zones 2 and 3., Skull Base Reconstruction ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Squamous cell carcinoma of right temporal bone/middle ear space.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Squamous cell carcinoma of right temporal bone/middle ear space.,PROCEDURE: , Right temporal bone resection; rectus abdominis myocutaneous free flap for reconstruction of skull base defect; right selective neck dissection zones 2 and 3.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought into the operating room, placed on the table in supine position.  General endotracheal anesthesia was obtained in the usual fashion.  The Neurosurgery team placed the patient in pins and after they positioned the patient the right lateral scalp was prepped with Betadine after shave as well as the abdomen.  The neck was prepped as well.  After this was performed, I made a wide ellipse of the conchal bowl with the Bovie and cutting current down through the cartilage of the conchal bowl.  A wide postauricular incision well beyond the mastoid tip extending into the right neck was then incised with the Bovie with the cutting current and a postauricular skin flap developed leaving the excise conchal bowl in place as the auricle was reflected over anterior to the condyle.  After this was performed, I used the Bovie to incise the soft tissue around the temporal bone away from the tumor on to the mandible.  The condyle was skeletonized so that it could be easily seen.  The anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid was dissected out and the spinal accessory nerve was identified and spared.  The neck contents to the hyoid were dissected out.  The hypoglossal nerve, vagus nerve, and spinal accessory nerve were dissected towards the jugular foramen.  The neck contents were removed as a separate specimen.  The external carotid artery was identified and tied off as it entered the parotid and tied with a Hemoclip distally for the future anastomosis.  A large posterior facial vein was identified and likewise clipped for later use.  I then used the cutting and diamond burs to incise the skull above the external auditory canal so as to expose the dura underneath this and extended it posteriorly to the sigmoid sinus, dissecting or exposing the dura to the level of the jugular bulb.  It became evident there was two tumor extending down the eustachian tube medial to the condyle and therefore I did use the router, I mean the side cutting bur to resect the condyle and the glenoid fossa to expose the medial extent of the eustachian tube.  The internal carotid artery was dissected out of the parapharyngeal space into the carotid canal and I drilled carotid canal up until it made.  I dissected the vertical segment of the carotid out as it entered the temporal bone until it made us turn to the horizontal portion.  Once this was dissected out, Dr. X entered the procedure for completion of the resection with the craniotomy.  For details, please see his operative note.,After Dr. X had completed the resection, I then harvested the rectus free flap.  A skin paddle was drawn out next to the umbilicus about 4 x 4 cm.  The skin paddle was incised with the Bovie and down to the anterior rectus sheath.  Sagittal incisions were made up superiorly and inferiorly to the skin paddle and the anterior rectus sheath dissected out above and below the skin paddle.  The sheath was incised to the midline and a small ellipse was made around the fascia to provide blood supply to the overlying skin.  The skin paddle was then sutured to the fascia and muscle with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl.  The anterior rectus sheath was then reflected off the rectus muscle, which was then divided superiorly with the Bovie and reflected out of the rectus sheath to an inferior direction.  The vascular pedicle could be seen entering the muscle in usual fashion.  The muscle was divided inferior to the pedicle and then the pedicle was dissected to the groin to the external iliac artery and vein where it was ligated with two large Hemoclips on each vessel.  The wound was then packed with saline impregnated sponges.  The rectus muscle with attached skin paddle was then transferred into the neck.  The inferior epigastric artery was sutured to the end of the external carotid with interrupted 9-0 Ethilon with standard microvascular technique.  Ischemia time was less than 10 minutes.  Likewise, the inferior epigastric vein was sutured to the end of the posterior facial vein with interrupted 9-0 Ethilon as well.  There was excellent blood flow through the flap and there were no or any issues with the vascular pedicle throughout the remainder of the case.  The wound was irrigated with copious amounts of saline.  The eustachian tube was obstructed with bone wax.  The muscle was then laid into position with the skin paddle underneath the conchal bowl.  I removed most the skin of the conchal bowl de-epithelializing and leaving the fat in place.  The wound was closed in layers overlying the muscle, which was secured superiorly to the muscle overlying the temporal skull.  The subcutaneous tissues were closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with skin staples.  There was small incision made in the postauricular skin where the muscle could be seen and the skin edges were sewn directly to the muscle as to the rectus muscle itself.  The skin paddle was closed with interrupted 4-0 Prolene to the edges of the conchal bowl.,The abdomen was irrigated with copious amounts of saline and the rectus sheath was closed with #1 Prolene with the more running suture, taking care to avoid injury to the posterior rectus sheath by the use of ribbon retractors.  The subcutaneous tissues were closed with interrupted 2-0 Vicryl and skin was closed with skin staples.  The patient was then turned over to the Neurosurgery team for awakening after the patient was appropriately awakened.  The patient was then transferred to the PACU in stable condition with spontaneous respirations, having tolerated the procedure well."

Department of Anesthesia administered general anesthetic.  Once adequately sedated, the patient was placed in the beach chair position.  Care was ensured that she was well positioned, adequately secured and padded.  At this point, the right upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A deltopectoral approach was used and taken down to the skin with a #15 blade scalpel.,At this point, blunt dissection with Mayo scissors was used to come to the overlying subscapular tendon and bursal tissue.  Any perforating bleeders were cauterized with Bovie to obtain hemostasis.  Once the bursa was seen, it was removed with a Rongeur and subscapular tendon could be easily visualized.  At this point, the rotator cuff in the subacromial region was evaluated.  There was noted to be a large rotator cuff, which was irreparable.  There was eburnated bone on the greater tuberosity noted.  The articular surface could be visualized.  The biceps tendon was intact.  There was noted to be diffuse discolored synovium around this as well as some fraying of the tendon in the intraarticular surface.  The under surface of the acromion, it was felt there was mild ware on this as well.  At this point, the subscapular tendon was then taken off using Bovie cautery and Metzenbaum scissors that was tied with Metzenbaum suture.  It was separated from the capsule to have a two layered repair at closure.  The capsule was also reflected posterior.  At this point, the glenoid surface could be easily visualized.  It was evaluated and had good cartilage contact and appeared to be intact.  The humeral head was evaluated.  There was noted to be ware of the cartilage and eburnated bone particularly in the central portion of the humeral head.  At this point, decision was made to proceed with the arthroplasty, since the rotator cuff tear was irreparable and there was significant ware of the humoral head.  The arm was adequately positioned.  An oscillating saw was used to make the head articular cut.  This was done at the margin of the articular surface with the anatomic neck.  This was taken down to appropriate level until this articular surface was adequately removed.  At this point, the intramedullary canal and cancellous bone could be easily visualized.  The opening hand reamers were then used and this was advanced to a size #10.  Under direct visualization, this was performed easily.  At this point, the 10 x 10 proximal flange cutter was then inserted and impacted into place to cut grooves for the fins.  This was then removed.  A trial component was then impacted into place, which did fit well and trial heads were then sampled and it was felt that a size 44 x 21 mm head gave us the best fit and appeared adequately secured.  It did not appear overstuffed with evidence of excellent range of motion and no impingement.  At this point, the trial component was removed.  Wound was copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  Cement was then placed with a cement gun into the canal and taken up to the level of the cut.  The prosthesis was then inserted into place and held under direct visualization.  All excess cement was removed and care was ensured that no cement was left in the posterior aspect of the joint itself.  This _______ cement was adequately hard at this point.  The final component of the head was impacted into place, secured on the Morris taper and checked, and this was reduced.,The final component was then taken through range of motion and found to have excellent stability and was satisfied with its position.  The wound was again copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  At this point, the capsule was then reattached to its insertion site in the anterior portion.  Once adequately sutured with #1-Vicryl, attention was directed to the subscapular.  The subscapular was advanced superiorly and anchored not only to the biceps tendon region, but also to the top anterior portion of the greater tuberosity.  This was opened to allow some type of coverage points of the massive rotator cuff tear.  This was secured to the tissue and interosseous sutures with size #2 fiber wire.  After this was adequately secured, the wound was again copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  The deltoid fascial split was then repaired using interrupted #2-0 Vicryl, subcutaneous tissue was then approximated using interrupted #24-0 Vicryl, skin was approximated using a running #4-0 Vicryl.  Steri-Strips and Adaptic, 4 x 4s, and ABDs were then applied.  The patient was then placed in a sling and transferred back to the gurney, reversed by Department of Anesthesia.,DISPOSITION: , The patient tolerated well and transferred to Postanesthesia Care Unit in satisfactory condition."

In addition, the extraoral area on the left neck was prepped with Betadine and draped accordingly.  Gauze throat pack was placed and local anesthetic was administered in the left lower quadrant, total of 3.4 mL of lidocaine 2% with 1:100,000 epinephrine and Marcaine 1.7 mL of 0.5% with 1:200,000 epinephrine.  An incision was made with #15 blade in the left submandibular area through the skin and blunt dissection was accomplished with curved mosquito hemostat to the inferior border of the mandible.  No purulent drainage was obtained.  The 0.25 inch Penrose drain was then placed in the extraoral incision and it was secured with 3-0 silk suture.  Moving to the intraoral area, periosteal elevator was used to elevate the periosteum from the buccal aspect of tooth #19.  The area did not drain any purulent material.  The carious tooth #19 was then extracted by elevator and forceps extraction.  After the tooth was removed, the 0.25 inch Penrose drain was placed in a subperiosteal fashion adjacent to the extraction site and secured with 3-0 silk suture.  The tube was then repositioned to the left side allowing access to the upper right quadrant where tooth #2 was then extracted by routine elevator and forceps extraction.  After the extraction, the throat pack was removed.  An orogastric tube was then placed by Dr. X, and stomach contents were suctioned.  The pharynx was then suctioned with the Yankauer suction.  The patient was awakened, extubated, and taken to the PACU in stable condition."

Informed consent was obtained. Patient received several sets of drops in his/her XXX eye including Ocuflox and Ocular. (S)He was taken to the operating room where monitored anesthetic care was initiated. Retrobulbar anesthesia was then administered to the XXX eye using a 50:50 mixture of 2% plain lidocaine and 0.05% Marcaine. The XXX eye was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile ophthalmic fashion. A speculum was placed on the eyelids and microscope was brought into position. A #7-0 Vicryl suture was passed through the superotemporal limbus and traction suture was placed at the superotemporal limbus and the eye was rotated infranasally so as to expose the superotemporal conjunctiva. At this point, smooth forceps and Westcott scissors were used to create a 100-degree superotemporal conjunctival peritomy, approximately 2 mm posterior to the superotemporal limbus. This was then dissected anteriorly to the limbus edge and then posteriorly. Steven scissors were then dissected in a superotemporal quadrant between the superior and lateral rectus muscles to provide good exposure. At this point, we primed the Ahmed valve with a #27 gauge cannula using BSS and it was noted to be patent. We then placed Ahmed valve in the superotemporal subconjunctival recess underneath the subtenon space and this was pushed posteriorly. We then measured with calipers so that it was positioned 9 mm posterior to the limbus. The Ahmed valve was then tacked down with #8-0 nylon suture through both fenestrations. We then applied light cautery to the superotemporal episcleral bed. We placed a paracentesis at the temporal position and inflated the anterior chamber with a small amount of Healon. We then used a #23 gauge needle and entered the superotemporal sclera, approximately 1 mm posterior to the limbus into the anterior chamber away from iris and away from cornea. We then trimmed the tube, beveled up in a 30 degree fashion with Vannas scissors, and introduced the tube through the #23 gauge tract into the anterior chamber so that approximately 2-3 mm of tube was extending into the anterior chamber. We burped some of the Healon out of the anterior chamber and filled it with BSS and we felt that the tube was in good position away from the lens, away from the cornea, and away from the iris. We then tacked down the tubes to the sclera with #8-0 Vicryl suture in a figure-of- eight fashion. The pericardium was soaked in gentamicin. We then folded the pericardium 1x1 cm piece onto itself and then placed it over the tube and this was tacked down in all four quadrants to the sclera with #8-0 nylon suture. At this point, we then re-approximated the conjunctiva to its original position and we closed it with an #8-0 Vicryl suture on a TG needle in a running fashion with interrupted locking bites. We then removed the traction suture. At the end of the case, the pupil was round, the chamber was deep, the tube appeared to be well positioned. The remaining portion of the Healon was burped out of the anterior chamber with BSS and the pressure was felt to be adequate. The speculum was removed. Ocuflox and Maxitrol ointment were placed over the eye. Then, an eye patch and shield were placed over the eye. The patient was awakened and taken to the recovery room in stable condition."

The patient subsequently went to the operating room on 07/25/2003 for a right hip hemiarthroplasty per the Orthopedics Department.  Subsequently, the patient was doing well postoperatively, however, the patient does have severe O2 and steroid-dependent COPD and at an extreme risk for any procedure.  The patient began developing abdominal pain over the course of the next several days and a consultation was requested on 08/07/2003 for surgical evaluation for upper abdominal pain.  During the evaluation, the patient was found to have an acute acalculous cholecystitis in which nonoperative management was opted for and on 08/08/03, the patient underwent a percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement to drain the gallbladder.  The patient did well postdrainage.  The patient's laboratory values and biliary values returned to normal and the patient was planned for a removal of the tube with 48 hours of the tubing clamp.  However, once the tube was removed, the patient re-obstructed with recurrent symptoms and a second tube was needed to be placed; this was done on 08/16/2003.  A HIDA scan had been performed, which showed no cystic duct obstruction.  A tube cholecystogram was performed, which showed no cystic or common duct obstruction.  There was abnormal appearance of the gallbladder, however, the pathway was patent.  Thus after failure of two nonoperative management therapies, extensive discussions were made with the family and the patient's only option was to undergo a cholecystectomy.  Initial thoughts were to do a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, however, with the patient's severe COPD and risk for ventilator management, the options were an epidural and an open cholecystectomy under local was made and to be performed.,INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS:  ,The patient's gallbladder had some patchy and necrosis areas.  There were particular changes on the serosal surface as well as on the mucosal surface with multiple clots within the gallbladder.  The patient also had no plane between the gallbladder and the liver bed.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , After informed written consent, risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient and discussed with the patient's family.  The patient was brought to the operating room after an epidural was performed per anesthesia.  Local anesthesia was given with 1% lidocaine.  A paramedian incision was made approximately 5 cm in length with a #15 blade scalpel.  Next, hemostasis was obtained using electro Bovie cautery.  Dissection was carried down transrectus in the midline to the posterior rectus fascia, which was grasped with hemostats and entered with a #10 blade scalpel.  Next, Metzenbaum scissors were used to extend the incision and the abdomen was entered .  The gallbladder was immediately visualized and brought up into view, grasped with two ring clamps elevating the biliary tree into view.  Dissection with a ______ was made to identify the cystic artery and cystic duct, which were both easily identified.  The cystic artery was clipped, two distal and one proximal to the gallbladder cutting between with Metzenbaum scissors.  The cystic duct was identified.  A silk tie #3-0 silk was placed one distal and one proximal with #3-0 silk and then cutting in between with a Metzenbaum scissors.  The gallbladder was then removed from the liver bed using electro Bovie cautery.  A plane was created.  The hemostasis was obtained using the electro Bovie cautery as well as some Surgicel.  The gallbladder was then removed as specimen, sent to pathology for frozen sections for diagnosis, of which the hemorrhagic cholecystitis was diagnosed on frozen sections.  Permanent sections are still pending.  The remainder of the fossa was hemostatic with the Surgicel and attention was next made to closing the abdomen.  The peritoneum as well as posterior rectus fascia was approximated with a running #0 Vicryl suture and then the anterior rectus fascia was closed in interrupted figure-of-eight #0 Vicryl sutures.  Skin staples were used on the skin and sterile dressings were applied and the patient was transferred to recovery in stable condition."

After adequate induction of general anesthesia, he was placed in the left lateral decubitus position.  All bony prominences were padded.  The right shoulder was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner using standard Betadine prep, entered through three standard arthroscopic portals anterolateral and posterior incising the skin with a knife using sharp and blunt trocar.,Serial examination of the intraarticular portion of the shoulder showed all the structures to be normal including the biceps tendon ligaments, articular surfaces, and labrum.  Subacromial space was entered.  Visualization was poor due to the hemorrhagic bursitis, and this was resected back.  It was essentially a type-3 acromion, which was converted to a type 1 by aiming the burr anterior from the posterior portal excising the larger anterior spur.  Rotator cuff was little bit fray, but otherwise intact.  Thus, the deep deltoid bursa and the markedly thickened coracoacromial ligament were removed.  The burr was then introduced to the anterior portal and the distal clavicle excision carried out.  The width of burr about 6 mm being careful to preserve the ligaments in the capsule, but removing the spurs and the denuded arthritic joint.,The patient tolerated the procedure very well.  The shoulder was then copiously irrigated, drained free of any residual debris.  The wound was closed with 3-0 Prolene.  Sterile compressive dressing applied.,The patient was then placed on his back in the supine position and the right upper extremity and the left lower extremity were prepped and draped in usual sterile manner using a standard Betadine prep.,The attention was first turned to the right hand where it was elevated, exsanguinated using an Esmarch bandage, and the tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg for about 25 minutes.  Volar approach to the carpal ligament was performed incising the skin with a knife and using cautery for hemostasis.  Tenotomy and forceps dissection carried out through the superficial palmar fascia, carried down to the volar carpal ligament, which was then transected sharply with a knife and carried proximal and distal under direct vision using the scissors being careful to avoid the neurovascular structures.,Cautery was used for hemostasis.  The never had an hourglass appearance where it was a kind of constricted as a result of the compression from the ligament, and so a small amount of Celestone was dripped onto the nerve to help quite it down.  The patient tolerated this portion of the procedure very well.  The hand was then irrigated, closed with Monocryl and Prolene, and sterile compressive dressing was applied and the tourniquet deflated.,Attention was then turned to the left knee where it was entered through inferomedial and inferolateral portals incising the skin with a knife and using sharp and blunt trocars.  After entering the knee through inferomedial and inferolateral standard arthroscopic portals, examination of the knee showed a displaced bucket-handle tear in the medial meniscus and a radial tear at the lateral meniscus.  These were resected back to the stable surface using a basket forceps and full-radius shaver.  There was no evidence of any other significant arthritis in the knee.  There was a lot of synovitis, and so after the knee was irrigated out and free of any residual debris, the knee was injected with Celestone and Marcaine with epinephrine.,The patient tolerated the procedure very well, and the wounds were closed with 3-0 Prolene and sterile compressive dressing was applied, and then the patient was taken to the recovery room, extubated, awake, alert, and in stable condition."

The patient was found to have lumbar diskitis and was going to require extensive antibiotic therapy, which was the cause of need for continued hospitalization.  He also needed to continue with dialysis and he needed to improve his rehabilitation.  The patient tolerated his medication well and he was going through rehab fairly well without any significant troubles.  He did have some bouts of issues with constipation on and off throughout his hospitalization, but this seemed to come under control with more aggressive management.  The patient had remained afebrile.  He did also have a bout with some episodic confusion problems, which appeared to be more of a sundowner-type of a problem, but this too cleared with his stay here at Promise.  On the day of discharge, on May 9, 2008, the patient was in good spirits, was very clear and lucid.  He denied any complaints of pain.  He did have some trouble with sleep at night at times, but I think this was mainly tied into the fact that he sleeps a lot during the day.  The patient has increased his appetite some and has been eating some.  His vital signs remain stable.  His blood pressure on discharge was 126/63, heart rate is 80, respiratory rate of 20 and temperature was 98.3.  PPD was negative.

After induction of IV sedation the left hand was anesthetized suitable for carpal tunnel release; 10 cc of a mixture of 1% Xylocaine and 0.5% Marcaine was injected in the distal forearm and proximal palm suitable for carpal tunnel surgery.  Routine prep and drape was employed.  Arm was exsanguinated by means of elevation of Esmarch elastic tourniquet and tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg pressure.  Hand was positioned palm up in the lead hand-holder.  A short curvilinear incision about the base of the thenar eminence was made.  Skin was sharply incised.  Sharp dissection was carried down to the transverse carpal ligament and this was carefully incised longitudinally along its ulnar margin.  Care was taken to divide the entire length of the transverse retinaculum including its distal insertion into deep palmar fascia in the midpalm.  Proximally the antebrachial fascia was released for a distance of 2-3 cm proximal to the wrist crease to insure complete decompression of the median nerve.  Retinacular flap was retracted radially to expose the contents of the carpal canal.  Median nerve was identified, seen to be locally compressed with moderate erythema and mild narrowing.  Locally adherent tenosynovium was present and this was carefully dissected free.  Additional tenosynovium was dissected from the flexor tendons, individually stripping and peeling each tendon in sequential order so as to debulk the contents of the carpal canal.  Epineurotomy and partial epineurectomy were carried out on the nerve in the area of mild constriction to relieve local external scarring of the epineurium.  When this was complete retinacular flap was laid loosely in place over the contents of the carpal canal and skin only was closed with interrupted 5-0 nylon horizontal mattress sutures.  A syringe with 3 cc of Kenalog-10 and 3 cc of 1% Xylocaine using a 25 gauge short needle was then selected; 1 cc of this mixture was injected into the third finger A1 and A2 pulley tendon sheaths using standard trigger finger injection technique; 1 cc was injected into the fourth finger A1/A2 pulley tendon sheath using standard tendon sheath injection technique; 1 cc was injected into the Dupuytren's nodule in the midpalm to relieve local discomfort.  Routine postoperative hand dressing with well-padded, well-molded volar plaster splint and lightly compressive Ace wrap was applied.  Tourniquet was deflated.  Good vascular color and capillary refill were seen to return to the tips of all digits.  Patient discharged to the ambulatory recovery area and from there discharged home.

Adequate general endotracheal anesthesia was induced.  Appropriate monitoring devices were placed.  The chest, abdomen and legs were prepped and draped in the sterile fashion.  The right greater saphenous vein was harvested and prepared by ligating all branches with 4-0 Surgilon and flushed with heparinized blood.  Hemostasis was achieved in the legs and closed with running 2-0 Dexon in the subcutaneous tissue and running 3-0 Dexon subcuticular in the skin.  Median sternotomy incision was made and the left mammary artery was dissected free from its takeoff of the subclavian to its bifurcation at the diaphragm and surrounded with papaverine-soaked gauze.  The pericardium was opened.  The pericardial cradle was created.  The patient was fully heparinized and cannulated with a single aortic and single venous cannula and bypass was instituted.  A retrograde cardioplegic cannula was placed with a pursestring suture of 4-0 Prolene suture in the right atrial wall into the coronary sinus and tied to a Rumel tourniquet.  An antegrade cardioplegic needle sump combination was placed in the ascending aorta and tied in place with 4-0 Prolene.  The ascending aorta was crossclamped.  Cold blood potassium cardioplegia was given to the ascending aorta followed by sumping through the ascending aorta followed by cold retrograde potassium cardioplegia.  The obtuse marginal coronary artery was identified and opened and end-to-side anastomosis was performed to the reversed autogenous saphenous vein with running 7-0 Prolene suture and the vein was cut to length.  Cold antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia were given and the posterior descending branch of the right coronary artery was identified and opened.  End-to-side anastomosis was performed with a running 7-0 Prolene suture and the vein was cut to length.  Cold antegrade and retrograde potassium cardioplegia were given.  The mammary artery was clipped distally, divided and spatulated for anastomosis.  The anterior descending was identified and opened.  End-to-side anastomosis was performed through the left internal mammary artery with running 8-0 Prolene suture.  The mammary pedicle was sutured to the heart with interrupted 5-0 Prolene suture.  A warm antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia were given.  The aortic crossclamp was removed.  The partial occlusion clamp was placed.  Aortotomies were made.  The veins were cut to fit these and sutured in place with running 5-0 Prolene suture.  A partial occlusion clamp was removed.  All anastomoses were inspected and noted to be patent and dry.  Ventricular and atrial pacing wires were placed.  The patient was fully warmed and weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass.  The patient was decannulated in the routine fashion and Protamine was given.  Good hemostasis was noted.  A single mediastinal and left pleural chest tube were placed.  The sternum was closed with interrupted wire, linea alba with running 0 Prolene, the sternal fascia was closed with running 0 Prolene, the subcutaneous tissue with running 2-0 Dexon and the skin with running 3-0 Dexon subcuticular stitch.

The patient presents for laparoscopic pyeloplasty.,PROCEDURE: , After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the operative suite and administered general anesthetic.  The patient was sterilely prepped and draped in the supine fashion after building up the right side of the OR table to aid in the patient's positioning for bowel retraction.  Hassan technique was performed for the initial trocar placement in the periumbilical region.  Abdominal insufflation was performed.  There were significant adhesions noted.  A second 12 mm port was placed in the right midclavicular line at the level of the umbilicus and a Harmonic scalpel was placed through this and adhesiolysis was performed for approximately two-and-half hours, also an additional port was placed 12 mm in the midline between the xiphoid process and the umbilicus, an additional 5 mm port in the right upper quadrant subcostal and midclavicular.  After adhesions were taken down, the ascending colon was mobilized by incising the white line of Toldt and mobilizing this medially.  The kidney was able to be palpated within Gerota's fascia.  The psoas muscle caudate to the inferior pole of the kidney was identified and the tissue overlying this was dissected to the level of the ureter.  The uterus was grasped with a Babcock through a trocar port and carried up to the level of the ureteropelvic junction obstruction.  The renal pelvis was also identified and dissected free.  There was significant fibrosis and scar tissue around the ureteropelvic junction obliterating the tissue planes.  We were unable to dissect through this mass of fibrotic tissue safely and therefore the decision was made to abort the laparoscopic procedure and perform the pyeloplasty open.  An incision was made from the right upper quadrant port extending towards the midline.  This was carried down through the subcutaneous tissue, anterior fascia, muscle layers, posterior fascia, and peritoneum.  A Bookwalter retractor was placed.  The renal pelvis and the ureter were again identified.  Fibrotic tissue was able to be dissected away at this time utilizing right angle clamps and Bovie cautery.  The tissue was sent down to Pathology for analysis.  Please note that upon entering the abdomen, all of the above which was taken down from the adhesions to the abdominal wall were carefully inspected and no evidence of bowel injury was noted.  Ureter was divided just distal to the ureteropelvic junction obstruction and stent was maintained in place.  The renal pelvis was then opened in a longitudinal manner and excessive pelvis was removed reducing the redundant tissue.  At this point, the indwelling double-J ureteral stent was removed.  At this time, the ureter was spatulated laterally and at the apex of this spatulation a #4-0 Vicryl suture was placed.  This was brought up to the deepened portion of the pyelotomy and cystic structures were approximated.  The back wall of the ureteropelvic anastomosis was then approximated with running #4-0 Vicryl suture.  At this point, a double-J stent was placed with a guidewire down into the bladder.  The anterior wall of the uteropelvic anastomosis was then closed again with a #4-0 running Vicryl suture.  Renal sinus fat was then placed around the anastomosis and sutured in place.  Please note in the inferior pole of the kidney, there was approximately 2 cm laceration which was identified during the dissection of the fibrotic tissue.  This was repaired with horizontal mattress sutures #2-0 Vicryl.  FloSeal was placed over this and the renal capsule was placed over this.  A good hemostasis was noted.  A #10 Blake drain was placed through one of the previous trocar sites and placed into the perirenal space away from the anastomosis.  The initial trocar incision was closed with #0 Vicryl suture.  The abdominal incision was also then closed with running #0 Vicryl suture incorporating all layers of muscle and fascia.  The Scarpa's fascia was then closed with interrupted #3-0 Vicryl suture.  The skin edges were then closed with staples.  Please note that all port sites were inspected prior to closing and hemostasis was noted at all sites and the fascia was noted to be reapproximated as these trocar sites were placed with the ________ obturator.  We placed the patient on IV antibiotics and pain medications.  We will obtain KUB and x-rays for stent placement.  Further recommendations to follow."

Monitors placed, including EKG, Pulse oximeter, and BP cuff.  Patient had a pillow placed under the shoulder blades.  The head and neck was allowed to fall back into hyperextension.  The neck region was prepped and draped in sterile fashion with Betadine and alcohol.  Four sterile towels were placed.  The cricothyroid membrane was palpated, then going one finger's breadth lateral from the cricothyroid membrane and one finger's breadth inferior, the carotid pulse was palpated and the sheath was retracted laterally.  A 22 gauge SMK 5-mm bare tipped needle was then introduced in between the cricothyroid membrane and the carotid sheath and directed inferiomedially.  The needle is advanced prudently through the tissues, avoiding the carotid artery laterally.  The tip of the needle is perceived to intersect with the vertebral body of Cervical #7 and this was visualized by fluoroscopy.  Aspiration was cautiously performed after the needle was retracted approximately 1 mm and held steady with left hand.  No venous or arterial blood return is noted.  No cerebral spinal fluid is noted.  Positive sensory stimulation was elicited using the Radionics unit at 50 Hz from 0-0.1 volts and negative motor stimulation was elicited from 1-10 volts at 2 Hz.  After negative aspiration through the 22 gauge SMK 5mm bare tipped needle is absolutely confirmed, 5 cc of solution (solution consisting of 5 cc of 0.5% Marcaine, 1 cc of triamcinolone) was then injected into the stellate ganglion region.  This was done with intermittent aspiration vigilantly verifying negative aspiration.  The stylet was then promptly replaced and neurolysis (nerve decompression) was then carried out for 60 seconds at 80 degrees centigrade.  This exact same procedure using the exact same protocol was repeated one more time to complete the two lesions of the stellate ganglion.  The patient was immediately placed in the sitting position to reduce any side effect from the stellate ganglion block associated with cephalad spread of the solution.  Pressure was placed over the puncture site for approximately five minutes to eliminate any hemorrhage from blood vessels that may have been punctured and a Band-Aid was placed over the puncture site.  Patient was monitored for an additional ten to fifteen minutes and was noted to have tolerated the procedure well without any adverse sequelae.  Significant temperature elevation was noted on the affected side verifying neurolysis of the ganglion.  ,Interpretation of radiograph reveals placement of the 22-gauge SMK 5-mm bare tipped needle in the region of the stellate ganglion on the affected side.

This afternoon, when I am seeing the patient, nursing informs me that rate has finally been controlled with esmolol, but systolic blood pressures have dropped to the 70s with a MAP of 52.  Dr. X was again consulted from the bedside.  We agreed to try fluid boluses and then to consider Neo-Synephrine pressure support if this is not successful.  In addition, over the last 24 hours, extensive discussions have been held with the family and questions answered by nursing staff concerning the patient's possible move to Tahoe Pacific or a long-term acute care.  Other issues requiring following up today are elevated transaminases, continuing fever, pneumonia, resolving adult respiratory distress syndrome, ventilatory-dependent respiratory failure, hypokalemia, non-ST-elevation MI, hypernatremia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, BPH, atrial flutter, inferior vena cava filter, and diabetes.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION,VITAL SIGNS:  T-max 103.2, blood pressure at this point is running in the 70s/mid 40s with a MAP of 52, heart rate is 100.,GENERAL:  The patient is much more alert appearing than my last examination of approximately 3 weeks ago.

If this does not work as discussed with Dr. X, we will start some Neo-Synephrine, but also continue with aggressive fluid repletion as I do think that indications are that with diminished and concentrated urine that he may still be down and fluids will still be required even if pressure support is started.,2.  Increased transaminases.  Presumably this is from increased congestion.  This is certainly concerning.  We will continue to follow this.  Ultrasound of the liver was apparently negative.,3.  Fever and elevated white count.  The patient does have a history of pneumonia and empyema.  We will continue current antibiotics per infectious disease and continue to follow the patient's white count.  He is not exceptionally toxic appearing at this time.

The patient underwent a colonoscopy which found this lesion and biopsies were taken proving invasive adenocarcinoma.  The patient was NG decompressed preoperatively and was prepared for surgery.  The need for removal of the colon cancer was explained at length.  The patient was agreeable to proceed with the surgery and signed preoperatively informed consent.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the Operative Suite and placed in the supine position under general anesthesia per Anesthesia Department and NG and Foley catheters were placed preoperatively.  She was given triple antibiotics IV.  Due to her near obstructive symptoms, a formal ________ was not performed.,The abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A midline laparotomy incision was made with a #10 blade scalpel and subcutaneous tissues were separated with electrocautery down to the anterior abdominal fascia.  Once divided, the intraabdominal cavity was accessed and bowel was protected as the rest of the abdominal wall was opened in the midline.  Extensive fluid was seen upon entering the abdomen, ascites fluid, which was clear straw-colored and this was sampled for cytology.  Next, the small bowel was retracted with digital exploration and there was a evidence of hepatic flexure, colonic mass, which was adherent to the surrounding tissues.  With mobilization of the colon along the line of Toldt down to the right gutter, the entire ileocecal region up to the transverse colon was mobilized into the field.  Next, a window was made 5 inches from the ileocecal valve and a GIA-75 was fired across the ileum.  Next, a second GIA device was fired across the proximal transverse colon, just sparring the middle colic artery.  The dissection was then carried down along the mesentry, down to the root of the mesentry.  Several lymph nodes were sampled carefully, and small radiopaque clips were applied along the base of the mesentry.  The mesentry vessels are hemostated and tied with #0-Vicryl suture sequentially, ligated in between.  Once this specimen was submitted to pathology, the wound was inspected.  There was no evidence of bleeding from any of the suture sites.  Next, a side-by-side anastomosis was performed between the transverse colon and the terminal ileum.  A third GIA-75 was fired side-by-side and GIA-55 was used to close the anastomosis.  A patent anastomosis was palpated.  The anastomosis was then protected with a #2-0 Vicryl #0-muscular suture.  Next, the mesenteric root was closed with a running #0-Vicryl suture to prevent any chance of internal hernia.  The suture sites were inspected and there was no evidence of leakage.  Next, the intraabdominal cavity was thoroughly irrigated with sterile saline and the anastomosis was carried into the right lower gutter.  Omentum was used to cover the intestines which appeared dilated and indurated from the near obstruction.  Next, the abdominal wall was reapproximated and the fascial layer using a two running loop PDS sutures meeting in the middle with good approximation of both the abdominal fascia.  Additional sterile saline was used to irrigate the subcutaneous fat and then the skin was closed with sequential sterile staples.,Sterile dressing was applied and the skin was cleansed and the patient was awakened from anesthesia without difficulty and extubated in the Operating Room and she was transferred to Recovery Room in stable condition and will be continued to be monitored on the Telemetry Floor with triple antibiotics and NG decompression.,"

Severe low back pain.", Anterior Lumbar Fusion ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Severe low back pain.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Severe low back pain.,OPERATIONS PERFORMED: , Anterior lumbar fusion, L4-L5, L5-S1, PEEK vertebral spacer, structural autograft from L5 vertebral body, BMP and anterior plate.,ANESTHESIA:,  General endotracheal.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Less than 50 mL.,DRAINS:,  None.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,PATHOLOGICAL FINDINGS:,  Dr. X made the approach and once we were at the L5-S1 disk space, we removed the disk and we placed a 13-mm PEEK vertebral spacer filled with a core of bone taken from the L5 vertebral body.  This was filled with a 15 x 20-mm Chronos VerteFill tricalcium phosphate plug.  At L4-L5, we used a 13-mm PEEK vertebral spacer with structural autograft and BMP, and then we placed a two-level 87-mm Integra sacral plate with 28 x 6-mm screws, two each at L4 and L5 and 36 x 6-mm screws at S1.,OPERATION IN DETAIL:,  The patient was placed under general endotracheal anesthesia.  The abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  Dr. X made the approach, and once the L5-S1 disk space was identified, we incised this with a knife and then removed a large core of bone taking rotating cutters.  I was able to remove additional disk space and score the vertebral bodies.  The rest of the disk removal was done with the curette, scraping the endplates.  I tried various sized spacers, and at this point, we exposed the L5 body and took a dowel from the body and filled the hole with a 15 x 20-mm Chronos VerteFill tricalcium phosphate plug.  Half of this was used to fill the spacer at L5-S1, BMP was placed in the spacer as well and then it was tapped into place.  We then moved the vessels over the opposite way approaching the L4-L5 disk space laterally, and the disk was removed in a similar fashion and we also used a 13-mm PEEK vertebral spacer, but this is the variety that we could put in from one side.  This was filled with bone and BMP as well.  Once this was done, we were able to place an 87-mm Integra sacral plate down over the three vertebral bodies and place these screws.  Following this, bleeding points were controlled and Dr. X proceeded with the closure of the abdomen.,SUMMARY: , This is a 51-year-old man who reports 15-year history of low back pain and intermittent bilateral leg pain and achiness.  He has tried multiple conservative treatments including physical therapy, epidural steroid injections, etc.  MRI scan shows a very degenerated disk at L5-S1, less so at L3-L4 and L4-L5.  A discogram was positive with the lower 3 levels, but he has pain, which starts below the iliac crest and I feel that the L3-L4 disk is probably that symptomatic.  An anterior lumbar interbody fusion was suggested.  Procedure, risks, and complications were explained."
92, The patient was referred to Medical Center's Outpatient Rehabilitation Department for skilled speech therapy to improve her functional communication skills and swallowing function and safety., Speech Therapy - Discharge Summary - 1 ,"HISTORY: , The patient is a 67-year-old female, was referred to Medical Center's Outpatient Rehabilitation Department for skilled speech therapy to improve her functional communication skills and swallowing function and safety.  At the onset of therapy, on 03/26/08, the patient was NPO with a G-tube and the initial speech and language evaluation revealed global aphasia with an aphasia quotient of 3.6/100 based on the Western Aphasia Battery.  Since the initial evaluation, the patient has attended 60 outpatient speech therapy sessions, which have focussed on her receptive communication, expressive language, multimodality communication skills, and swallowing function and safety.,SHORT-TERM GOALS:,1.  The patient met 3 out of 4 original short-term therapy goals, which were to complete a modified barium swallow study, which she did do and which revealed no aspiration.  At this time, the patient is eating and drinking and taking all medications by mouth; however, her G-tube is still present.  The patient was instructed to talk to the primary care physician about removal of her feeding tube.,2.  The patient will increase accuracy of yes-no responses to greater than 80% accuracy.  She did accomplish this goal.  The patient is also able to identify named objects with greater than 80% accuracy.,ADDITIONAL GOALS: , Following the completion of these goals, additional goals were established.  Based on reevaluation, the patient met 2 out of these 3 initial goals and she is currently able to read and understand simple sentences with greater than 90% accuracy independently and she is able to write 10 words related to basic wants and needs with greater than 80% accuracy independently.  The patient continues to have difficulty stating verbally, yes or no, to questions as well as accurately using head gestures and to respond to yes-no questions.  The patient continues to have marked difficulty with her expressive language abilities.  She is able to write simple words to help express her basic wants and needs.  She has made great strides; however, with her receptive communication, she is able to read words as well as short phrases and able to point to named objects and answer simple-to-moderate complex yes-no questions.  A reevaluation completed on 12/01/08, revealed an aphasia quotient of 26.4.  Once again, she made significant improvement and comprehension, but continues to have unintelligible speech.  An alternative communication device was discussed with the patient and her husband, but at this time, the patient does not want to utilize a communication device.  If, in the future, the patient continues to struggle with her expressive communication, an alternative augmented communication device would be a benefit to her.  Please reconsult at that time if and when the patient is ready to use a speech generating device.  The patient is discharged from my services at this time due to a plateau in her progress.  Numerous home activities were recommended to allow her to continue to make progress at home."
93," Total hip replacement.  An incision was made, centered over the greater trochanter.  Dissection was sharply carried down through the subcutaneous tissues. ", Total Hip Replacement - 1 ,"PROCEDURE:,  Total hip replacement.,PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:,  The patient was bought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  After induction of anesthesia, the patient was turned on the side and secured in the hip table.  An incision was made, centered over the greater trochanter.  Dissection was sharply carried down through the subcutaneous tissues.  The gluteus maximus was incised and split proximally.  The piriformis and external rotators were identified.  These were removed from their insertions on the greater trochanter as a sleeve with the hip capsule.  The hip was dislocated.  A femoral neck cut was made using the guidance of preoperative templating.  The femoral head was removed.  Extensive degenerative disease was found on the femoral head as well as in the acetabulum.,Baseline leg-length measurements were taken.  The femur was retracted anteriorly and a complete labrectomy was performed.  Reaming of the acetabulum was then performed until adequate bleeding subchondral bone was identified in the key areas.  The trial shell was placed and found to have an excellent fit.  The real shell was opened and impacted into position in the appropriate amount of anteversion and abduction.  Screws were placed by drilling into the pelvis, measuring, and placing the appropriate length screw.  Excellent purchase was obtained.  The trial liner was placed.,The femur was then flexed and internally rotated.  The extra trochanteric bone was removed, as was any leftover lateral soft tissue at the piriformis insertion.  An intramedullary hole was drilled into the femur to define the canal.  Reaming was performed until the appropriate size was reached.  The broaches were then used to prepare the femur with the appropriate amount of version.  Once the appropriate size broach was reached, it was used as a trial with head and neck placement.  Hip range-of-motion was checked in all planes, including flexion-internal rotation, the position of sleep, and extension-external rotation.  The hip was found to have excellent stability with the final chosen head-neck combination.  Leg length measurements were taken and found to be within acceptable range, given the necessity for stability.,The real stem was opened and impacted into position.  The real head was impacted atop the stem.  If cement was used, the canal was thoroughly washed and dried and plugged with a restrictor, and then the cement was injected and pressurized and the stem was implanted in the appropriate version.  Excess cement was removed from the edges of the component.  Range of motion and stability were once again checked and found to be excellent.  Adequate hemostasis was obtained.  Vigorous power irrigation was used to remove all debris from the joint prior to final reduction.,The arthrotomy and rotators were closed using #1 Ethibond through drill holes in the bone, recreating the posterior hip structural anatomy.  The gluteus maximus was repaired using 0 Ethibond and 0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissues were closed after further irrigation with 2-0 Vicryl and Monocryl sutures.  The skin was closed with nylon.  Xeroform and a sterile dressing were applied followed by a cold pack and Ace wrap.  The patient was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition, having tolerated the procedure well."
94, Cadaveric renal transplant to right pelvis - endstage renal disease., Renal Transplant - Cadaveric ,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  ,The patient is a 50-year-old African American female with past medical history significant for hypertension and endstage renal disease, on hemodialysis secondary to endstage renal disease, last hemodialysis was on June 22, 2007.  The patient presents with no complaints for cadaveric renal transplant.  After appropriate cross match and workup of HLA typing of both recipient and cadaveric kidneys, the patient was deemed appropriate for operative intervention and transplantation of kidney.,PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Endstage renal disease.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Endstage renal disease.,PROCEDURE:,  Cadaveric renal transplant to right pelvis.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , 400 mL.,FLUIDS:  ,One liter of normal saline and one liter of 5% of albumin.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General endotracheal.,SPECIMEN:  ,None.,DRAIN: , None.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,The patient tolerated the procedure without any complication.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room, prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  After adequate anesthesia was achieved, a curvilinear incision was made in the right pelvic fossa approximately 9 cm in length extending from the 1.5 cm medial of the ASIS down to the suprapubic space.  After this was taken down with a #10 blade, electrocautery was used to take down tissue down to the layer of the subcutaneous fat.  Camper's and Scarpa's were dissected with electrocautery.  Hemostasis was achieved throughout the tissue plains with electrocautery.  The external oblique aponeurosis was identified with musculature and was entered with electrocautery.  Then hemostats were entered in and dissection continued down with electrocautery down through the external internal obliques and the transversalis fascia.  Additionally, the rectus sheath was entered in a linear fashion.  After these planes were entered using electrocautery, the retroperitoneum was dissected free from the transversalis fascia using blunt dissection.  After the peritoneum and peritoneal structures were moved medially and superiorly by blunt dissection, the dissection continued down bluntly throughout the tissue planes removing some alveolar tissue over the right iliac artery.  Upon entering through the transversalis fascia, the epigastric vessels were identified and doubly ligated and tied with #0 silk ties.  After the ligation of the epigastric vessels, the peritoneum was bluntly dissected and all peritoneal structures were bluntly dissected to a superior and medial plane.  This was done without any complication and without entering the peritoneum grossly.  The round ligament was identified and doubly ligated at this time with #0 silk ties as well.  The dissection continued down now to layer of the alveolar tissue covering the right iliac artery.  This alveolar tissue was cleared using blunt dissection as well as electrocautery.  After the external iliac artery was identified, it was cleared circumferentially all the way around and noted to have good flow and had good arterial texture.  The right iliac vein was then identified, and this was cleared again using electrocautery and blunt dissection.  After the right iliac vein was identified and cleared off all the alveolar tissue, it was circumferentially cleared as well.  An additional perforating branch was noted at the inferior pole of the right iliac vein.  This was tied with a #0 silk tie and secured.  Hemostasis was achieved at this time and the tie had adequate control.  The dissection continued down and identified all other vital structures in this area.  Careful preservation of all vital structures was carried out throughout the dissection.  At this time, Satinsky clamp was placed over the right iliac vein.  This was then opened using a #11 blade, approximately 1 cm in length.  The heparinized saline was placed and irrigated throughout the inside of the vein, and the kidney was pulled into the abdominal field still covered in its protective socking with the superior pole marked.  The renal vein was then elevated and identified in this area.  A 5-0 double-ended Prolene stitch was used to secure the renal vein, both superiorly and inferiorly, and after appropriately being secured with 5-0 Prolene, these were tied down and secured.  The renal vein was then anastomosed to the right iliac vein in a circumferential manner in a running fashion until secured at both superior and inferior poles.  The dissection then continued down and the iliac artery was then anastomosed to the renal artery at this time using a similar method with 5-0 Prolene securing both superior and inferior poles.  After such time the 5-0 Prolene was run around in a circumferential manner until secured in both superior and inferior poles once again.  After this was done and the artery was secured, the Satinsky clamp was removed and a bulldog placed over.  The flow was then opened on the arterial side and then opened on the venous side to allow for proper flow.  The bulldog was then placed back on the renal vein and allowed for the hyperperfusion of the kidney.  The kidney pinked up nicely and had a good appearance to it and had appearance of good blood flow.  At this time, all Satinsky clamps were removed and all bulldog clamps were removed.  The dissection then continued down to the layer of the bladder at which time the bladder was identified.  Appropriate area on the dome the bladder was identified for entry.  This was entered using electrocautery and approximately 1 cm length after appropriately sizing and incising of the ureter using the Metzenbaum scissors in a linear fashion.  Before this was done, #0 chromic catgut stitches were placed and secured laterally and inferiorly on the dome of the bladder to elevate the area of the bladder and then the bladder was entered using the electrocautery approximately 1 cm in length.  At this time, a renal stent was placed into the ureter and secured superiorly and the stent was then placed into the bladder and secured as well.  Subsequently, the superior and inferior pole stitches with 5-0 Prolene were used to secure the ureter to the bladder.  This was then run mucosa-to-mucosa in a circumferential manner until secured in both superior and inferior poles once again.  Good flow was noted from the ureter at the time of operation.  Additional Vicryl stitches were used to overlay the musculature in a seromuscular stitch over the dome of the bladder and over the ureter itself.  At this time, an Ethibond stitch was used to make an additional seromuscular closure and rolling of the bladder musculature over the dome and over the anastomosis once again.  This was inspected and noted for proper control.  Irrigation of the bladder revealed that the bladder was appropriately filled and there were no flows and no defects.  At this time, the anastomoses were all inspected, hemostasis was achieved and good closure of the anastomosis was noted at this time.  The kidney was then placed back into its new position in the right pelvic fossa, and the area was once again inspected for hemostasis which was achieved.  A 1-0 Prolene stitch was then used for mass closure of the external, internal, and transversalis fascias and musculature in a running fashion from superior to inferior.  This was secured and knots were dumped.  Subsequently, the area was then checked and inspected for hemostasis which was achieved with electrocautery, and the skin was closed with 4-0 running Monocryl.  The patient tolerated procedure well without evidence of complication, transferred to the Dunn ICU where he was noted to be stable.  Dr. A was present and scrubbed through the entire procedure."

The patient was brought to the operating room and placud in the supine position, where (s)he wad prepped and draped in the routine fashion. A wire lid speculum was placed to provide exposure.,Upon examination and dissection of the conjunctiva superiorly, a scleral rupture was found. The rupture extended approximately 15 mm in length superior to the cornea, approximately 2 mm from the limbus in a horizontal fashion. There was also a rupture at the limbus, near the middle of this laceration, causing the anterior chamber to be flat. There was a large blood clot filling the anterior chamber. An attempt was made to wash out the anterior chamber with BSS on a cannula. The BSS was injected through the limbal rupture, which communicated with the anterior chamber. The blood clot did not move. It was extremely adherent to the iris.,At that time, the rupture that involved the limbus from approximately 10:30 until 12 o'clock was closed using 1 suture of 10-0 nylon. The scleral laceration was then closed using 10 interrupted sutures with 9-0 Vicryl. At that time, the anterior chamber was formed and appeared to be fairly deep. The wounds were checked and found to be watertight. The knots were rotated posteriorly and the conjunctiva was draped up over the sutures and sewn into position at the limbus using four 7-0 Vicryl sutures, 2 nasally and 2 temporally. All suture knots were buried.  ,Gentamicin 0.5 cc was injected subconjunctivally. Then, the speculum was removed. The drapes were removed. Several drops of Ocuflox and Maxitrol ointment were placed in the XXX eye. An eye patch and shield were placed over the eye. The patient was awakened from general anesthesia without difficulty and taken to the recovery room in good condition."

The patient was found to have moderately stenotic aortic valve.  In addition, The patient had significant coronary artery disease consisting of a chronically occluded right coronary artery but a very important large obtuse marginal artery coming off as the main circumflex system.  The patient also has a left anterior descending artery which has moderate disease and this supplies quite a bit of collateral to the patient's right system.  It was decided to perform a valve replacement as well as coronary artery bypass grafting procedure.,FINDINGS: , The left ventricle is certainly hypertrophied· The aortic valve leaflet is calcified and a severe restrictive leaflet motion.  It is a tricuspid type of valve.  The coronary artery consists of a large left anterior descending artery which is associated with 60% stenosis but a large obtuse marginal artery which has a tight proximal stenosis.,The radial artery was used for the left anterior descending artery.  Flow was excellent.  Looking at the targets in the posterior descending artery territory, there did not appear to be any large branches.  On the angiogram these vessels appeared to be quite small.  Because this is a chronically occluded vessel and the patient has limited conduit due to the patient's massive obesity, attempt to bypass to this area was not undertaken.  The patient was brought to the operating room,PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in supine position.  A median sternotomy incision was carried out and conduits were taken from the left arm as well as the right thigh.  The patient weighs nearly three hundred pounds.  There was concern as to taking down the left internal mammary artery.  Because the radial artery appeared to be a good conduit The patient would have arterial graft to the left anterior descending artery territory.  The patient was cannulated after the aorta and atrium were exposed and full heparinization.,The patient went on cardiopulmonary bypass and the aortic cross-clamp was applied Cardioplegia was delivered through the coronary sinuses in a retrograde manner.  The patient was cooled to 32 degrees.  Iced slush was applied to the heart.  The aortic valve was then exposed through the aortic root by transverse incision.  The valve leaflets were removed and the #23 St. Jude mechanical valve was secured into position by circumferential pledgeted sutures.  At this point, aortotomy was closed.,The first obtuse marginal artery was a very large target and the vein graft to this target indeed produced an excellent amount of flow.  Proximal anastomosis was then carried out to the foot of the aorta.  The left anterior descending artery does not have severe disease but is also a very good target and the radial artery was anastomosed to this target in an end-to-side manner.  The two proximal anastomoses were then carried out to the root of the aorta.,The patient came off cardiopulmonary bypass after aortic cross-clamp was released.  The patient was adequately warmed.

Informed consent was obtained. The patient received IV antibiotics including Ancef and Levaeuin prior to surgery. The patient was brought to the operating room and placud in the supine position, where (s)he wad prepped and draped in the routine fashion. A wire lid speculum was carefully placed to provide exposure. A two-armed 7 mm scleral laceration was seen in the supranasal quadrant. The laceration involved the sclera and the limbus in this area. There was a small amount of iris tissue prolapsed in the wound. The Westcott scissors and 0.12 forceps were used to carefully dissect the conjunctiva away from the wound to provide exposure. A cyclodialysis spatula was used to carefully reposit the prolapsed iris tissue back into the anterior chamber. The anterior chamber remained formed and the iris tissue easily resumed its normal position. The pupil appeared round. An 8-0 nylon suture was used to close the scleral portion of the laceration. Three sutures were placed using the 8-0 nylon suture. Then 9-0 nylon suture was used to close the limbal portion of the wound. After the wound appeared closed, a Superblade was used to create a paracentesis at approximately 2 o'clock. BSS was injected through the paracentesis to fill the anterior chamber. The wound was checked and found to be watertight. No leaks were observed. An 8-0 Vicryl suture was used to reposition the conjunctiva and close the wound. Three 8-0 Vicryl sutures were placed in the conjunctiva. All scleral sutures were completely covered. The anterior chamber remained formed and the pupil remained round and appeared so at the end of the case. Subconjunctival injections of Ancef and dexamethasone were given at the end of the case as well as Tobradex ointment. The lid speculum was carefully removed. The drapes were carefully removed. Sterile saline was used to clean around the XXX eye as well as the rest of the face. The area was carefully dried and an eye patch and shield were taped over the XXX eye. The patient was awakened from general anesthesia without difficulty. (S)he was taken to the recovery area in good condition. There were no complications."

His left back was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  Xylocaine 1% was used to infiltrate his chest wall and the chest entered upon the ninth intercostal space in the midscapular line and the thoracentesis catheter was used and placed, and then we proceed to draw by hand about 1200 mL blood.  This blood was nonclotting and it was tested twice.  Halfway during the procedure, the patient felt that he was getting dizzy and his pressure at that time had dropped to the 80s.  Therefore, we laid him off his right side while keeping the chest catheter in place.  At that time, I proceeded to continuously draw fluids slowly and then when the patient recovered we sat him up again and we proceed to complete the procedure.,Overall besides the described episode, the patient tolerated the procedure well and afterwards, we took another chest x-ray that showed much improvement in the pleural effusion and at that particular time, with all the history we proceeded to admit the patient for observation and with an idea to obtain a CT in the morning to see whether the patient would need an pigtail intrapleural catheter or not."

The patient was found to have a complex mass in the upper pole and the lower pole of the kidney.  MRI and CAT scan showed questionable renal mass, which could be malignant.  Initial plan was to let the patient stabilize for 2 weeks and perform the nephrectomy.  At this point, the patient was unable to go home.  The patient continually complained of pain.  The patient required about 3 to 4 units of blood transfusions prior.  The patient initially came in with hemoglobin less than 5.  The hemoglobin prior to surgery was 10.,Risks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, PE, respiratory failure, morbidity and mortality of the procedure due to her low ejection fraction were discussed.  Cardiac clearance was obtained.  The patient was high risk, family and the patient knew about the risk.  The recommendation from the pulmonologist, cardiologist, and medical team was to get the kidney out at this point because the patient and the family stated that they would not do well at home without any intervention.  The patient and family understood all the risks and benefits in order to proceed with the surgery.,DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE:,  The patient was brought to the OR.  Anesthesia was applied.  The patient had A-line triple-lumen catheter.  The patient was placed in left side up, right side down oblique position.  All the pressure points were well padded.  The right fistula was carefully padded completely around it.  Axilla was protected.  The fistula was checked throughout the procedure to ensure that it was stable.  The arms, ankles, knees, and joints were all padded with foam.  The patient was taped to the table using 2-inch wide tape.  OG and a Foley catheter were in place.  A supraumbilical incision was made about 6 cm in size and incision was carried through the subcutaneous tissue and through the fascia and peritoneum was entered sharply.  There were some adhesions where the omentum was into the umbilical hernia, which was completely stuck.  The omentum was released out of that just so we could obtain pneumoperitoneum.  Pneumoperitoneum was obtained after using GelPort.  Two 12-mm ports were placed in the left anterior axillary line, and mid clavicular line.  The colon was reflected medially.  Kidney was dissected laterally behind and inferiorly.  There was large hematoma visualized with significant amount of old blood, which was irrigated out.  Dissection was carried superiorly and the spleen was reflected medially.  The spleen and colon were all intact at the end of the procedure.  They were stable all throughout.  Using endovascular GIA stapler, all the medial and lateral dissection was carried through the stapler to ensure that the patient had minimal bleeding due to low cardiac reserve.  Hemostasis was obtained.  The renal vein and the renal artery were stapled and there was excellent hemostasis.,The dissection was carried lateral to the adrenal and medial to the right kidney.  The adrenal was preserved.  The entire kidney was removed through the hand port.  Irrigation was performed.  There was excellent hemostasis at the end of the nephrectomy.  Fibrin glue and Surgicel were applied just in case the patient had delayed DIC.  The colon was placed back and 12-mm ports were closed under direct palpation using 0 Vicryl.  The fascia was closed using loop #1 PDS in a running fashion and was tied in the middle.  Please note that prior to the fascial closure, the peritoneum was closed using 0 Vicryl in running fashion.  The subcuticular tissue was brought together using 4-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed using 4-0 Monocryl.  Dermabond was applied.  The patient was brought to the recovery in a stable condition."

The patient was elected to have a left modified radical mastectomy, she was not interested in a partial mastectomy.  She is aware of the risks and complications of surgery, and wished to proceed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room.  She underwent general endotracheal anesthetic.  The TED stockings and venous compression devices were placed on both lower extremities and they were functioning well.  The patient's left anterior chest wall, neck, axilla, and left arm were prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  The recent biopsy site was located in the upper and outer quadrant of left breast.  The plain incision was marked along the skin.  Tissues and the flaps were injected with 0.25% Marcaine with epinephrine solution and then a transverse elliptical incision was made in the breast of the skin to include nipple areolar complex as well as the recent biopsy site.  The flaps were raised superiorly and just below the clavicle medially to the sternum, laterally towards the latissimus dorsi, rectus abdominus fascia.  Following this, the breast tissue along with the pectoralis major fascia were dissected off the pectoralis major muscle.  The dissection was started medially and extended laterally towards the left axilla.  The breast was removed and then the axillary contents were dissected out.  Left axillary vein and artery were identified and preserved as well as the lung _____.  The patient had several clinically palpable lymph nodes, they were removed with the axillary dissection.  Care was taken to avoid injury to any of the above mentioned neurovascular structures.  After the tissues were irrigated, we made sure there were no signs of bleeding.  Hemostasis had been achieved with Hemoclips.  Hemovac drains x2 were then brought in and placed under the left axilla as well as in the superior and inferior breast flaps.  The subcu was then approximated with interrupted 4-0 Vicryl sutures and skin with clips.  The drains were sutured to the chest wall with 3-0 nylon sutures.  Dressing was applied and the procedure was completed.  The patient went to the recovery room in stable condition."

Radiographic gastrostomy tube study with gastric contrast, interpretation.,ANESTHESIA: , General anesthesia.,INDICATIONS OF THE PROCEDURE: , The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of chronic esophageal stricture who is admitted with food sticking and retching.  He has esophageal rupture on CT scan and comes now for a thoracotomy and gastrostomy.,DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE: , After an extensive informed consent discussion process, the patient was brought to the operating room.  He was placed in a supine position on the operating table.  After induction of general anesthesia and placement of a double lumen endotracheal tube, he was turned and placed in a right lateral decubitus position on a beanbag with appropriate padding and axillary roll.  Left chest was prepped and draped in a usual sterile fashion.  After administration of intravenous antibiotics, a left thoracotomy incision was made, dissection was carried down to the subcutaneous tissues, muscle layers down to the fifth interspace.  The left lung was deflated and the pleural cavity entered.  The Finochietto retractor was used to help provide exposure.  The sixth rib was shingled in the posterior position and a careful expiration of the left pleural cavity was performed.,Immediately encountered was left pleural fluid including some purulent fluid.  Cultures of this were sampled and sent for microbiology analysis.  The left pleural space was then copiously irrigated.  A careful expiration demonstrated that the rupture appeared to be sealed.  There was crepitus within the mediastinal cavity.  The mediastinum was opened and explored and the esophagus was explored.  The tissues of the esophagus appeared to show some friability and an area of the rupture in the distal esophagus.  It was not possible to place any stitches in this tissue and instead a small intercostal flap was developed and placed to cover the area.  The area was copiously irrigated, this provided nice coverage and repair.  After final irrigation and inspection, two chest tubes were placed including a #36 French right angled tube at the diaphragm and a posterior straight #36 French.  These were secured at the left axillary line region at the skin level with #0-silk.,The intercostal sutures were used to close the chest wall with a #2 Vicryl sutures.  Muscle layers were closed with running #1 Vicryl sutures.  The wound was irrigated and the skin was closed with skin staples.,The patient was then turned and placed in a supine position.  A laparoscopic gastrostomy was performed and then a diagnostic laparoscopy performed.  A Veress needle was carefully inserted into the abdomen, pneumoperitoneum was established in the usual fashion, a bladeless 5-mm separator trocar was introduced.  The laparoscope was introduced.  A single additional left-sided separator trocar was introduced.  It was not possible to safely pass a nasogastric or orogastric tube, pass the stricture and perforation and so the nasogastric tube was left right at the level where there was some stricture or narrowing or resistance.  The stomach however did have some air insufflation and we were able to place our T-fasteners through the anterior abdominal wall and through the anterior gastric wall safely.  The skin incision was made and the gastric lumen was then accessed with the Seldinger technique.  Guide wire was introduced into the stomach lumen and series of dilators was then passed over the guide wire.  #18 French Gastrostomy was then passed into the stomach lumen and the balloon was inflated.  We confirmed that we were in the gastric lumen and the balloon was pulled up, creating apposition of the gastric wall and the anterior abdominal wall.  The T-fasteners were all crimped and secured into position.  As was in the plan, the gastrostomy was secured to the skin and into the tube.  Sterile dressing was applied.

108," Selective coronary angiography, coronary angioplasty.  Acute non-ST-elevation MI.", Selective Coronary Angiography & Angioplasty ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS AND INDICATIONS:,  Acute non-ST-elevation MI.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS AND SUMMARY:,  The patient presented with an acute non-ST-elevation MI.  Despite medical therapy, she continued to have intermittent angina.  Angiography demonstrated the severe LAD as the culprit lesion.  This was treated as noted above with angioplasty alone as the stent could not be safely advanced.  She has residual lesions of 75% in the proximal right coronary and 60% proximal circumflex, and the other residual LAD lesions as noted above.  She will be continued on her medical therapy.  At age 90, she is not a good candidate for aortic valve replacement and coronary bypass grafting.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Selective coronary angiography, coronary angioplasty.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the cath lab, placed on the table in the supine position.  The area of the right femoral artery was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  Using the percutaneous technique, a 6-French sheath was placed in the right femoral artery under fluoroscopic guidance.  With the guidewire in place, a 5-French JL-4 catheter was used to selectively angiogram the left coronary system.  The catheter was removed.  The sheath flushed.  The 5-French 3DRC catheter was then used to selectively angiogram the right coronary artery.  The cath removed, the sheath flushed.,It was decided that intervention was needed in the severe lesions in the LAD, which appeared to be the culprit lesions for the non-ST elevation-MI.  The patient was given a bolus of heparin and an ACT of approximately 50 seconds was obtained, we rebolused and the ACT was slightly lower.  We repeated the level and it was slightly higher.  We administered 500 more units of heparin and then proceeded with an ACT of approximately 270 seconds prior to the 500 units of heparin IV.  Additionally, the patient had been given 300 mg of Plavix orally during the procedure and Integrilin IV bolus and then maintenance drip was started.,A 6-French CLS 3.5 left coronary guide catheter was used to cannulate the left main and HEW guidewire was positioned in the distal LAD and another HEW guidewire in the relatively large third diagonal.  An Apex 2.5 x 15 mm balloon was positioned in the distal portion of the mid LAD stenosis and inflated to 6 atmospheres for 15 seconds and then deflated.  Angiography was then performed, demonstrated marked improvement in the stenosis and this image was used for sizing the last of the needed stent.  The balloon was pulled more proximally and then inflated again at 6 atmospheres for approximately 20 seconds, with the proximal end of the balloon positioned distal to the origin of the third diagonal so as to not compromise the ostium.  The balloon was inflated and removed, repeat angiography performed.  We attempted to advance a Driver 2.5 x 24 mm bare metal stent, but I could not advance it beyond the proximal LAD, where there was significant calcification.  The stent was removed.  Attempts to advance the same 2.5 x 15 mm Apex balloon that was previously used were unsuccessful.  It was removed, a new Apex 2.5 x 15 mm balloon was then positioned in the proximal LAD and inflated to 6 atmospheres for 15 seconds and then deflated and advanced slightly with the distal tip of the balloon proximal to the third diagonal ostium and it was inflated to 6 atmospheres for 15 seconds and then deflated and removed.  Repeat angiography demonstrated no evidence of dissection.  One more attempt was made to advance the Driver 2.5 x 24 mm bare metal stent, but again I could not advance it beyond the calcified plaque in the proximal LAD and this was despite the presence of the buddy wire in the diagonal.  I felt that further attempts in this calcified vessel in a 90-year-old with severe aortic stenosis and severe aortic insufficiency would likely result in complications of dissection, so the stent was removed.  The guidewires and guide cath were removed.  The sheath flushed and sutured into position.  The patient moved to ICU in stable condition with no chest discomfort at all.,CONTRAST: , Isovue-370, 120 mL.,FLUORO TIME: , 9.4 minutes.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , 30 mL.,HEMODYNAMICS:,  Aorta 185/54.,Left ventriculography was not performed.  I did not make an attempt to cross this severely stenotic aortic valve.,The left main is a large vessel, giving rise to LAD and circumflex vessels.  The left main has no significant disease other than calcification in the walls.,The LAD is a moderate-to-large vessel, giving rise to small diagonals and then a moderate-to-large third diagonal, and then a small fourth diagonal.  The LAD has significant calcification proximally.  There is a 50% stenosis between the first and second diagonals that we treated with angioplasty alone in an attempt to be able to advance the stent.  This resulted in a 30% residual, mostly eccentric calcified plaque.  Following this, there was a 50% stenosis in the LAD just after the takeoff of the third diagonal.  This was not ballooned.  Beyond this is an 80% stenosis prior to the fourth diagonal and then a 99% stenosis after the fourth diagonal.  These 2 lesions were dilated with 10% residual prior to the fourth diagonal and 25% residual distal to the fourth diagonal.  As noted above, this area was not stented because I could not safely advance the stent.  Note, there was also a 50% stenosis at the origin of the moderate-to-large third diagonal that did not change with angioplasty.,The circumflex is a large, nondominant vessel consisting of a large obtuse marginal with multiple branches.  The proximal circumflex has an eccentric 60% stenosis prior to the takeoff of the obtuse marginal.  The remainder of the vessel was without significant disease.,The right coronary was a large, dominant vessel giving rise to a large posterior descending artery and small-to-moderate first posterolateral, small second posterolateral, and a small-to-moderate third posterolateral branch.  The right coronary has an eccentric smooth 75% stenosis beginning about a centimeter after the origin of the vessel and prior to the acute marginal branch.  The remainder of the right coronary and its branches were without significant disease."

He presented initially to the emergency room with throat and bleeding. Following evaluation by ENT and biopsy, it was determined to be squamous cell carcinoma of the right tonsil and soft palate, The patient is to undergo radiation therapy and possibly chemotherapy and will need prolonged enteral feeding with a bypass route from the mouth. The malignancy was not obstructing. Following obtaining informed consent for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube with possible conversion to open procedure, we elected to proceed following diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma and election for radiation therapy.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:, The patient was placed in the supine position and general endotracheal anesthesia was induced. Preoperatively, 1 gram of Ancef was given. The abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. After anesthesia was achieved, an endoscope was placed down into the stomach, and no abnormalities were noted. The stomach was insufflated with air and the endoscope was positioned in the midportion and directed towards the anterior abdominal wall. With the room darkened and intensity turned up on the endoscope, a light reflex was noted on the skin of the abdominal wall in the left upper quadrant at approximately 2 fingerbreadths inferior from the most inferior rib. Finger pressure was applied to the light reflex with adequate indentation on the stomach wall on endoscopy. A 21-gauge 1-1/2 inch needle was initially placed at the margin of the light reflex, and this was done twice. Both times it was not visualized on the endoscopy. At this point, repositioning was made and, again, what was felt to be adequate light reflex was obtained, and the 14-gauge angio catheter was placed. Again, after two attempts, we were unable to visualize the needle in the stomach endoscopically. At this point, decision was made to convert the procedure to an open Stamm gastrostomy.,OPEN STAMM GASTROSTOMY: ,A short upper midline incision was made and deepened through the subcutaneous tissues. Hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery. The linea alba was identified and incised, and the peritoneal cavity was entered. The abdomen was explored. Adhesions were lysed with electrocautery under direct vision. The stomach was identified, and a location on the anterior wall near the greater curvature was selected. After lysis of adhesions was confirmed, we sufficiently moved the original chosen site without tension. A pursestring suture of #3-0 silk was placed on the interior surface of the stomach, and a second #3-0 pursestring silk stitch was placed exterior to that pursestring suture. An incision was then made at the location of the anterior wall which was near the greater curvature and was dissected down to the anterior abdominal wall. A Vanderbilt was used to pass through the abdominal wall in through the skin and then returned to the level of the skin and pulled the Bard feeding tube through the anterior wall into the field. An incision in the center of the pursestring suture on the anterior surface of the stomach was then made with electrocautery. The interior pursestring suture was sutured into place in such a manner as to inkwell the stomach around the catheter. The second outer concentric pursestring suture was then secured as well and tied to further inkwell the stomach. The stomach was then tacked to the anterior abdominal wall at the catheter entrance site with four #2-0 silk sutures in such a manner as to prevent leakage or torsion. The catheter was then secured to the skin with two #2-0 silk sutures. Hemostasis was checked and the peritoneal cavity was washed out and brought to the surgical field. Prior to the initiation of the gastrotomy, the bowel was run and at that time there was noted to be one incidental colotomy. This was oversewn with three #4-0 silk Lembert sutures. At the completion of the operation, the fascia was closed with #1 interrupted Vicryl suture, and the skin was closed with staples. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the postanesthesia care unit in stable condition."

Negative EKG criteria for ischemia.", Dobutamine Stress Test - 1 ,"DOBUTAMINE STRESS ECHOCARDIOGRAM,REASON FOR EXAM: , Chest discomfort, evaluation for coronary artery disease.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was brought to the cardiac center.  Cardiac images at rest were obtained in the parasternal long and short axis, apical four and apical two views followed by starting with a dobutamine drip in the usual fashion at 10 mcg/kg per minute for low dose, increased every 2 to 3 minutes by 10 mcg/kg per minute.  The patient maximized at 30 mcg/kg per minute.  Images were obtained at that level after adding 0.7 mg of atropine to reach maximal heart rate of 145.  Maximal images were obtained in the same windows of parasternal long and short axis, apical four and apical two windows.,Wall motion assessed at all levels as well as at recovery.,The patient got nauseated, had some mild shortness of breath.  No angina during the procedure and the maximal amount of dobutamine was 30 mcg/kg per minute.,The resting heart rate was 78 with the resting blood pressure 186/98.  Heart rate reduced by the vasodilator effects of dobutamine to 130/80.  Maximal heart rate achieved was 145, which is 85% of age-predicted heart rate.,The EKG at rest showed sinus rhythm with no ST-T wave depression suggestive of ischemia or injury.  Incomplete right bundle-branch block was seen.  The maximal stress test EKG showed sinus tachycardia.  There was subtle upsloping ST depression in III and aVF, which is a normal response to the tachycardia with dobutamine, but no significant depression suggestive of ischemia and no ST elevation seen.,No ventricular tachycardia or ventricular ectopy seen during the test.  The heart rate recovered in a normal fashion after using metoprolol 5 mg.,The heart images were somewhat suboptimal to evaluate because of obesity and some problems with the short axis windows mainly at peak exercise.,The EF at rest appeared to be normal at 55 to 60 with normal wall motion including anterior, anteroseptal, inferior, lateral, and septal walls at low dose.  All walls mentioned were augmented in a normal fashion.  At maximum dose, all walls were augmented on all views except for the short axis was foreshortened, was uncertain about the anterolateral wall at peak exercise; however, of the other views, the lateral wall was showing normal thickening and normal augmentation.  EF improved to about 70%.,The wall motion score was unchanged.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Maximal dobutamine stress echocardiogram test achieving more than 85% of age-predicted heart rate.,2.  Negative EKG criteria for ischemia.,3.  Normal augmentation at low and maximum stress test with some uncertainty about the anterolateral wall in peak exercise only on the short axis view.  This is considered the negative dobutamine stress echocardiogram test, medical management."

The patient is very difficult to obtain information from; however, he appears to be having frequent nausea and vomiting with an aspiration pneumonia and abdominal discomfort.  In addition, this hospitalization, he has undergone an upper endoscopy, which found a small ulcer after dropping his hematocrit and becoming anemic.  He had a CT scan on Friday, 11/02/07, which apparently showed pneumatosis and his cecum worrisome for ischemic colitis as well as bilateral hydronephrosis and multiple liver lesions, which could be metastatic disease versus cysts.  In discussions with the patient, he had multiple bowel movements yesterday and is currently passing flatus and has epigastric pain.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  ,Obtained from the medical chart.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, history of pneumonia, and aspiration pneumonia, osteoporosis, alcoholism, microcytic anemia.,MEDICATIONS: , Per his current medical chart.,ALLERGIES: , NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , The patient had a long history of smoking but quit many years ago.  He does have chronic alcohol use.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL:  A very thin white male who is dyspneic and having difficulty breathing at the moment.,VITAL SIGNS:  Afebrile.  Heart rate in the 100s to 120s at times with atrial fibrillation.  Respiratory rate is 17-20.  Blood pressure 130s-150s/60s-70s.,NECK:  Soft and supple, full range of motion.,HEART:  Regular.,ABDOMEN:  Distended with tenderness mainly in the upper abdomen but very difficult to localize due to his difficulty providing information.  He does appear to have tenderness but does not have rebound and does not have peritoneal signs.,DIAGNOSTICS: , A CT scan done on 11/02/07 shows pneumatosis in the cecum with an enlarged cecum filled with stool and air fluid levels with chronically dilated small bowel.,ASSESSMENT: , Possible ischemic cecum with possible metastatic disease, bilateral hydronephrosis on atrial fibrillation, aspiration pneumonia, chronic alcohol abuse, acute renal failure, COPD, anemia with gastric ulcer.,PLAN: , The patient appears to have pneumatosis from a CT scan 2 days ago.  Nothing was done about it at that time as the patient appeared to not be symptomatic, but he continues to have nausea and vomiting with abdominal pain, but the fact that pneumatosis was found 2 days ago and the patient has survived this long indicates this may be a benign process at the moment, and I would recommend getting a repeat CT scan to assess it further to see if there is worsening of pneumatosis versus resolution to further evaluate the liver lesions and make decisions regarding planning at that time.  The patient has frequent desaturations secondary to his aspiration pneumonia, and any surgical procedure or any surgical intervention would certainly require intubation, which would then necessitate long-term ventilator care as he is not someone who would be able to come off of a ventilator very well in his current state.  So we will look at the CT scan and make decisions based on the findings as far as that is concerned."

After induction of IV sedation a right upper extremity axillary block anesthetic was performed by anesthesia staff.  Routine prep and drape was employed.  Patient received 1 gm of IV Ancef preoperatively.  Arm was exsanguinated by means of elevation of Esmarch elastic tourniquet.  Tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg pressure.  Hand positioned palm up in a lead hand-holder.  A longitudinal zigzag incision over the volar radial wrist mass was made.  Skin was sharply incised.  Careful blunt dissection was used in the subcutaneous tissue.  Antebrachial fascia was bluntly dissected and incised to reveal the radial artery.  Radial artery was mobilized preserving its dorsal and palmar branches.  Small transverse concomitant vein branches were divided to facilitate mobilization of the radial artery.  Wrist mass was exposed by blunt dissection.  This appeared to be an inflammatory arthritic mass from the volar radial wrist capsule.  This was debrided down to the wrist capsule with visualization of the joint through a small capsular window.  After complete volar synovectomy the capsular window was closed with 4-0 Mersilene figure-of-eight suture.  Subcutaneous tissue was closed with 4-0 PDS and the skin was closed with a running subcuticular 4-0 Prolene.  Forearm was pronated and C-arm image intensifier was used to confirm localization of the radial styloid for marking of the skin incision.  An oblique incision overlying the radial styloid centered on the second extensor compartment was made.  Skin was sharply incised.  Blunt dissection was used in the subcutaneous tissue.  Care was taken to identify and protect the superficial radial nerve.  Blunt dissection was carried out in the extensor retinaculum.  This was incised longitudinally over the second extensor compartment.  EPL tendon was identified, mobilized and released to facilitate retraction and prevent injury.  The interval between the ECRL and the ECRB was developed down to bone.  Dorsal capsulotomy was made and local synovitis was identified.  This was debrided and sent as second pathologic specimen.  Articular surface of the scaphoid was identified and seen to be completely devoid of articular cartilage with hard, eburnated subchondral bone consistent with a SLAC pattern arthritis.  Radial styloid had extensive spurring and was exposed subperiosteally and osteotomized in a dorsal oblique fashion preserving the volar cortex as the attachment point of the deep volar carpal ligament layer.  Dorsally the styloidectomy was beveled smooth and contoured with a rongeur.  Final x-rays documenting the styloidectomy were obtained.  Local synovitis beneath the joint capsule was debrided.

Tracheostomy.,2.  Thyroid isthmusectomy.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal tube.,BLOOD LOSS: , Minimal, less than 25 cc.,INDICATIONS:,  The patient is a 50-year-old gentleman who presented to the Emergency Department who had had multiple massive strokes.  He had required ventilator assistance and was transported to the ICU setting.  Because of the numerous deficits from the stroke, he is expected to have a prolonged ventilatory course and he will be requiring long-term care.,PROCEDURE: , After all risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed with multiple family members in detail, informed consent was obtained.  The patient was brought to the Operative Suite where he was placed in supine position and general anesthesia was delivered through the existing endotracheal tube.  The neck was then palpated and marked appropriately in the cricoid cartilage sternal notch and thyroid cartilage marked appropriately with felt-tip marker.  The skin was then anesthetized with a mixture of 1% lidocaine and 1:100,000 epinephrine solution.  The patient was prepped and draped in usual fashion.  The surgeons were gowned and gloved.  A vertical skin incision was then made with a #15 blade scalpel extending from approximately two fingerbreadths above the level of the sternum approximately 1 cm above the cricoid cartilage.  Blunt dissection was then carried down until the fascia overlying the strap muscles were identified.  At this point, the midline raphe was identified and the strap muscles were separated utilizing the Bovie cautery.  Once the strap muscles have been identified, palpation was performed to identify any arterial aberration.  A high-riding innominate was not identified.  At this point, it was recognized that the thyroid gland was overlying the trachea could not be mobilized.  Therefore, dissection was carried down through to the cricoid cartilage at which point hemostat was advanced underneath the thyroid gland, which was then doubly clamped and ligated with Bovie cautery.  Suture ligation with #3-0 Vicryl was then performed on the thyroid gland in a double interlocking fashion.  This cleared a significant portion of the trachea.  The overlying pretracheal fascia was then cleared with use of pressured forceps as well as Bovie cautery.  Now, a tracheal hook was placed underneath the cricoid cartilage in order to stabilize the trachea.  The second tracheal ring was identified.  The Bovie cautery reduced to create a tracheal window beneath the second tracheal ring that was inferiorly based.  At this point, the anesthetist was appropriately alerted to deflate the endotracheal tube cuff.  The airway was entered and inferior to the base, window was created.  The anesthetist then withdrew the endotracheal tube until the tip of the tube was identified.  At this point, a #8 Shiley tracheostomy tube was inserted freely into the tracheal lumen.  The balloon was inflated and the ventilator was attached.  He was immediately noted to have return of the CO2 waveform and was ventilating appropriately according to the anesthetist.  Now, all surgical retractors were removed.  The baseplate of the tracheostomy tube was sutured to the patient's skin with #2-0 nylon suture.  The tube was further secured around the patient's neck with IV tubing.  Finally, a drain sponge was placed.  At this point, procedure was felt to be complete.  The patient was returned to the ICU setting in stable condition where a chest x-ray is pending."

Large patulous anastomosis between posterior aspect of the left atrium and anterior aspect of the pulmonary venous confluence.  Nonobstructed ascending vein ligated.  Patent ductus arteriosus diminutive left atrium with posterior atrial septal defect with deficient inferior margin.  At completion of the procedure, right ventricular pressure approximating one-half of systemic, normal sinus rhythm, good biventricular function by visual inspection.,PROCEDURE: , After the informed consent, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating room table in supine position.  Upon induction of general endotracheal anesthesia and placement of indwelling arterial and venous monitoring lines.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion from chin to groins.  A median sternotomy incision was performed.  Dissection was carried through the deeper planes until the sternum was scored and divided with an oscillating saw.  A subtotal thymectomy was performed.  Systemic heparinization was achieved and the pericardium was entered and fashioned until cradle.  A small portion of the anterior pericardium was procured and fixed in glutaraldehyde for patch closure of segment of the atrial septal defect during the procedure.  Pursestrings were deployed on the ascending aorta on the right.  Atrial appendage.  The aorta was then cannulated with an 8-French aorta cannula and the right atrium with an 18-French Polystan right-angle cannula.  With an ACT greater than 400, greater pulmonary bypass was commenced with excellent cardiac decompression and the patent ductus arteriosus was ligated with a 2-0 silk tie.  Systemic cooling was started and the head was packed  and iced and systemic steroids were administered.  During cooling, traction suture was placed in the apex of the left ventricle.  After 25 minutes of cooling, the aorta was cross-clamped and the heart arrested by administration of 30 cubic centimeter/kilogram of cold-blood cardioplegia delivered directly within the aortic root following the aorta cross-clamping.  Following successful cardioplegic arrest, a period of low flow perfusion was started and a 10-French catheter was inserted into the right atrial appendage substituting the 18-French Polystan venous cannula.  The heart was then rotated to the right side and the venous confluence was exposed.  It was incised and enlarged and a corresponding incision in the dorsal and posterior aspect of the left atrium was performed.  The two openings were then anastomosed in an end-to-side fashion with several interlocking sutures to avoid pursestring effect with a running 7-0 PDS suture.  Following completion of the anastomosis, the heart was returned into the chest and the patient's blood volume was drained into the reservoir.  A right atriotomy was then performed during the period of circulatory arrest.  The atrial septal defect was very difficult to expose, but it was sealed with an autologous pericardial patch was secured in place with a running 6-0 Prolene suture.  The usual deairing maneuvers were carried out and lining was administered and the right atriotomy was closed in two layers with a running 6-0 Prolene sutures.  The venous cannula was reinserted.  Cardiopulmonary bypass restarted and the aorta cross-clamp was released.  The patient returned to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously and started regaining satisfactory hemodynamics which, following a prolonged period of rewarming, allow for us to wean her from cardiopulmonary bypass successfully and moderate inotropic support and sinus rhythm.  Modified ultrafiltration was carried out and two sets of atrial and ventricular pacing wires were placed as well as the peritoneal dialysis catheter and two 15-French Blake drains.  Venous decannulation was followed by aortic decannulation and administration of protamine sulfate.  All cannulation sites were oversewn with 6-0 Prolene sutures and the anastomotic sites noticed to be hemostatic.  With good hemodynamics and hemostasis, the sternum was then smeared with vancomycin, placing closure with stainless steel wires.

A thoracostomy tube was placed at the bedside with only partial resolution of the pleural effusion.  On CT scan evaluation, there is evidence of an entrapped right lower lobe with loculations.  Decision was made to proceed with surgical intervention for a complete decortication and the patient understands the need for surgery and signed the preoperative informed consent.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operative suite and placed in the supine position under general anesthesia per Anesthesia Department.  Intraoperative bronchoscopy was performed by Dr. Y and evaluation of carina, left upper and lower lobes with segmental evidence of diffuse mucous, thick secretions which were thoroughly lavaged with sterile saline lavage.  Samples were obtained from both the left and the right subbronchiole segments for Gram stain cultures and ASP evaluation.  The right bronchus lower, middle, and upper were also examined and subsegmental bronchiole areas were thoroughly examined with no evidence of masses, lesions, or suspicious extrinsic compressions on the bronchi.  At this point, all mucous secretions were thoroughly irrigated and aspirated until the airways were clear.  Bronchoscope was then removed.  Vital signs remained stable throughout this portion of the procedure.  The patient was re-intubated by Anesthesia with a double lumen endotracheal tube.  At this point, the patient was repositioned in the left lateral decubitus position with protection of all pressure points and the table was extended in customary fashion.  At this point, the right chest was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The chest tube was removed before prepping the patient and the prior thoracostomy site was cleansed thoroughly with Betadine.  The first port was placed through this incision intrathoracically.  A bronchoscope was placed for inspection of the intrathoracic cavity.  Pictures were taken.  There is extensive fibrinous exudate noted under parietal and visceral pleura, encompassing the lung surface, diaphragm, and the posterolateral aspect of the right thorax.  At this point, a second port site anteriorly was placed under direct visualization.  With the aid of the thoracoscopic view, a Yankauer resection device was placed in the thorax and blunt decortication was performed and aspiration of reminder of the pleural fluid.  Due to the gelatinous nature of the fibrinous exudate, there were areas of right upper lobe that adhered to the chest wall and the middle and lower lobes appeared entrapped.  Due to the extensive nature of the disease, decision was made to open the chest in a formal right thoracotomy fashion.  Incision was made.  The subcutaneous tissues were then electrocauterized down to the level of the latissimus dorsi, which was separated with electrocautery down to the anterior 6th rib space.  The chest cavity was entered with the right lung deflated per Anesthesia at our request.  Once the intrathoracic cavity was accessed, a thorough decortication was performed in meticulous systematic fashion starting with the right upper lobe, middle, and the right lower lobe.  With the expansion of the lung and reduction of the pleural surface fibrinous extubate, warm irrigation was used and the lungs allowed to re-expand.  There was no evidence of gross leakage or bleeding at the conclusion of surgery.,Full lung re-expansion was noted upon re-inflation of the lung.  Two #32 French thoracostomy tubes were placed, one anteriorly straight and one posteriorly on the diaphragmatic sulcus.  The chest tubes were secured in place with #0-silk sutures and placed on Pneumovac suction.  Next, the ribs were reapproximated with five interrupted CTX sutures and latissimus dorsi was then reapproximated with a running #2-0 Vicryl suture.  Next, subcutaneous skin was closed sequentially with a cosmetic layered subcutaneous closure.  Steri-Strips were applied along with sterile occlusive dressings.  The patient was awakened from anesthesia without difficulty and extubated in the operating room.  The chest tubes were maintained on Pleur-Evac suction for full re-expansion of the lung.  The patient was transported to the recovery with vital signs stable.  Stat portable chest x-ray is pending.  The patient will be admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for close monitoring overnight."

The patient states that he was well until about three days prior to presentation when he first started to experience some pain when defecating.  The following day he noted increasing pain and first noted blood on the surface of his stool.  The pain worsened on the subsequent day with increasing bleeding as well as some mucopurulent anal discharge.  The patient denies any previous history of rectal bleeding or pain.  He also denies any previous sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and states that he was screened for HIV infection eight months ago and was negative.  The patient does state that he has not felt well for the past week.  He states that he had felt ""feverish"" on several occasions but has not taken his temperature.  He has also complained of some abdominal discomfort with nausea and diarrhea as well as generalized myalgias and fatigue.  He thinks he has lost a few pounds but has not been weighing himself to determine the exact amount of weight loss.,The patient states that he has been sexually active since age 13.  He admits to eight previous partners and states that he ""usually"" uses a condom.  On further questioning, the patient states that of his eight partners, three were female and five were male.  His most recent sexual partner was a 38-year-old man whom he has been with for the past six months.  He states that he has been tested for STDs in the past but states that he only gave urine and blood for the testing.  He is unaware of the HIV status of his partner but assumes that the partner is uninfected because he looks healthy.  The patient also admits to one episode of sexual abuse at the age of 8 by a friend of the family.  As the man was a member of the family's church, the patient never felt comfortable disclosing this to any of the adults in his life.  He is very concerned about disclosure of his sexual behavior to his family, as they have expressed very negative comments concerning men who have sex with men.  He is accessing care in the ED unaccompanied by an adult.,PHYSICAL EXAM: , Thin but non-toxic young man with clear discomfort.,Pulse = 105,RR = 23,BP = 120/62,HEENT:  Several areas of white plaque-like material on the buccal mucosa.,Neck:  Multiple anterior/posterior cervical nodes in both anterior and posterior chains- 1-2 cm in diameter.,Lungs:  Clear to auscultation.,Cardiac:  Quiet precordium.,Nl S1/S2 with a II/VI systolic murmur. ,Abdomen:  Soft without hepatosplenomegaly.,GU:  Tanner V male with no external penile lesions.,Lymph:  2-3 cm axillary nodes bilaterally.,1-2 cm epitrochlear nodes.,Multiple 1-2 cm inguinal nodes.,Rectal:  Extremely painful digital exam.,+ gross blood and mucous.,LABORATORY EVALUATION:,Hbg = 12.  5 gm/dL,Hct = 32%,WBC = 3.9 thou/µL,Platelets = 120,000 thou/µL,76% neutrophils,19% lymphocytes,1% eosinophils,4% monocytes,ALT = 82 U/L,AST= 90 U/L,Erythrocyte sedimentation rate = 90,Electrolytes = normal,Gram stain of anal swab:  numerous WBCs,DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: , This patient is presenting with acute rectal pain with bleeding and anal discharge.  The patient also presents with some constitutional symptoms including fever, fatigue, abdominal discomfort, and adenopathy on physical examination.  The following are in the differential diagnosis:  Acute Proctitis and  Proctocolitis.,ACUTE HIV SEROCONVERSION: , This subject is sexually active and reports inconsistent condom use.  Gastrointestinal symptoms have recently been reported commonly in patients with a history of HIV seroconversion.  The rectal symptoms of bleeding and pain are not common with HIV, and an alternative diagnosis would be required.,PERIRECTAL ABSCESS: , A patient with a history of receptive anal intercourse is at risk for developing a perirectal abscess either from trauma or a concurrent STD.  The patient could experience more systemic symptoms with fever and malaise, as found with this patient.  However, the physical examination did not reveal the typical localized area of pain and edema.,DIAGNOSIS:  ,The subject had rectal cultures obtained, which were positive for Neisseria gonorrhoeae.  An HIV ELISA was positive, as was the RNA PCR.,DISCUSSION: , This patient demonstrates a number of key issues to consider when caring for an adolescent or young adult.  First, the patient utilized the emergency department for care as opposed to identifying a primary care provider.  Although not ideal in many circumstances, testing for HIV infection is crucial when there is suspicion, since many newly diagnosed patients identify earlier contacts with health care providers when HIV counseling and testing were not performed.  Second, this young man has had both male and female sexual partners.  As young people explore their sexuality, asking about partners in an open, nonjudgmental manner without applying labels is integral to helping the young person discuss their sexual behaviors.  Assuming heterosexuality is a major barrier to disclosure for many young people who have same-sex attractions.  Third, screening for STDs must take into account sexual behaviors.  Although urine-based screening has expanded testing of young people, it misses anal and pharyngeal infections.  If a young person is only having receptive oral or anal intercourse, urine screening is insufficient to rule out STDs.  Fourth, this young man had both localized and systemic symptoms.  As his anal symptoms were most suggestive of a current STD, performing an HIV test should be part of the standard evaluation.  In addition, as acute infection is on the differential diagnosis, PCR testing should also be considered.  The care provided to this young man included the following.  He was treated presumptively for proctitis with both IM ceftriaxone as well as oral doxycycline to treat N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis.  Ceftriaxone was chosen due to the recent reports of resistant N gonorrhoeae.  At the time of the diagnosis, the young man was given the opportunity to meet with the case manager from the adolescent-specific HIV program.  The case manager linked this young man directly to care after providing brief counseling and support.  The case manager maintained contact with the young man until his first clinical visit four days later.  Over the subsequent three months, the young man had two sets of laboratory testing to stage his HIV infection.,Set #1 CD4 T-lymphocyte count = 225 cells/mm3, 15% ,Quantitative RNA PCR = 75,000 copies/mL"

The cocaine-soaked cottonoids were removed from the nasal passages bilaterally and zero-degree otoscope was placed all the way to the patient's nasopharynx.  The patient had a severely deviated nasal septum more so to the right than the left.  There appeared to be a spur on the left inferior aspect and also on the right posterior aspect.  The nasopharyngeal mass appeared polypoid in nature almost lymphoid tissue looking.  It was then localized with 1% lidocaine with epinephrine 1:100,000 of approximately 3 cc total.  After this, the lesion was then removed on the right side with the XPS blade.  The torus tubarius was noted on the left side with the polypoid lymphoid tissue involving this area completely.  This area was taken down with the XPS blade.  Prior to taking down this lesion with the XPS, multiple biopsies were taken with a straight biter.  After this, a cocaine-soaked cottonoid was placed back in the patient's left nasal passage region and the nasopharynx and the attention was then drawn to the right side.  The zero-degree otoscope was placed in the patient's right nasal passage and all the way to the nasopharynx.  Again, the XPS was then utilized to take down the nasopharyngeal mass in its entirety with some involvement overlying the torus tubarius.  After this, the patient was then hemostatically controlled with suctioned Bovie cauterization.  A FloSeal was then placed followed by bilateral Merocels and bacitracin-coated ointment.  The patient's Meroceles were then tied together to the patient's forehead and the patient was then turned back to the Anesthesia.  The patient was extubated in the operating room and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and sent home and with instructions to followup approximately in one week.  The patient will be sent home with a prescription for Keflex 500 mg one p.o. b.i.d, and Tylenol #3 one to two p.o. q.4-6h. pain #30."

I explained fully the procedure to the patient.,PROCEDURE: , Both sides were done exactly the same way.  After 1% Xylocaine infiltration, a 2 to 3-cm incision was made over the temporal artery.  The temporal artery was identified and was grossly normal on both sides.  Proximal and distal were ligated with both of 3-0 silk suture and Hemoccult.  The specimen of temporal artery was taken from both sides measuring at least 2 to 3 cm.  They were sent as separate specimens, right and left labeled.  The wound was then closed with interrupted 3-0 Monocryl subcuticular sutures and Dermabond.  She tolerated the procedure well."

The old right frontal scalp incision was reopened in a curvilinear manner, and the Bactiseal ventricular catheter was identified as it went into the right frontal horn.  The distal end of the VA shunt was flushed and tested with heparinized saline, found to be patent, and it was then clamped.  Endoscopically, the proximal end was explored and we found debris within the lumen, and then we were able to freely move the catheter around.  We could see along the tract that the tip of the catheter had gone into the surrounding tissue and appeared to have prongs or extensions in the tract, which were going into the catheter consistent with partial proximal obstruction.  A Portnoy ventricular catheter was endoscopically introduced and then the endoscope was bend so that the catheter tip did not go into the same location where it was before, but would take a gentle curve going into the right lateral ventricle.  It flushed in quite well, was left at about 6.5 cm to 7 cm and connected to the existing straight connector and secured with 2-0 Ethibond sutures.  The wounds were irrigated out with Bacitracin and closed in a routine manner using two 3-0 Vicryl for the galea and a 4-0 running Monocryl for the scalp followed by Mastisol and Steri-Strips.  The patient was awakened and extubated having tolerated the procedure well without complications.  It should be noted that the when we were irrigating through the ventricular catheter, fluid easily came out around the catheter indicating that the patient had partial proximal obstruction so that we could probably flow around the old shunt tract and perhaps this was leading to some of the symptomatology or findings of fluid along the chest."

There was stenosis in the mid-venous limb of the graft.,INDICATIONS: , The patient is an 81-year-old African-American female who presents with an occluded left forearm loop graft.  She was not able to have her dialysis as routine.  Her potassium was dramatically elevated at 7 the initial evening of anticipated surgery.  Both Surgery and Anesthesia thought this would be too risky to do.  Thus, she was given medications to decrease her potassium and a temporary hemodialysis catheter was placed in the femoral vein noted for her to have dialysis that night as well as this morning.  This morning her predialysis potassium was 6, and thus she was scheduled for surgery after her dialysis.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operative suite and prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A transverse incision was made at the region of the venous anastomosis of the graft.  Further dissection was carried down to the catheter.  The vein appeared to be soft and without thrombus.  This outflow did not appear to be significantly impaired.  A transverse incision was made with a #11 blade on the venous limb of the graft near the anastomosis.  Next, a thrombectomy was done using a #4 Fogarty catheter.  Some of the clot and thrombus was removed from the venous limb.  The balloon did hang up in the multiple places along the venous limb signifying some degree of stenosis.  Once removing most of the clots from the venous limb prior to removing the plug, dilators were passed down the venous limb also indicating the area of stenosis.  At this point, we felt the patient would benefit from a curettage of the venous limb of the graft.  This was done and subsequent passes with the dilator and the balloon were then very easy and smooth following the curettage.  The Fogarty balloon was then passed beyond the clot and the plug.  The plug was visualized and inspected.  This also gave a good brisk bleeding from the graft.  The patient was heparinized and hep saline solution was injected into the venous limb and the angle vascular clamp was applied to the venous limb.  Attention was directed up to its anastomosis and the vein.  Fogarty balloon and thrombectomy was also performed well enough into this way.  There was good venous back bleeding following this.  The area was checked for any stenosis with the dilators and none was present.  Next, a #6-0 Prolene suture was used in a running fashion to close the graft.  Just prior to tying the suture, the graft was allowed to flush to move any debris or air.  The suture was also checked at that point for augmentation, which was good.  The suture was tied down and the wound was irrigated with antibiotic solution.  Next, a #3-0 Vicryl was used to approximate the subcutaneous tissues and a #4-0 undyed Vicryl was used in a running subcuticular fashion to approximate the skin edges.  Steri-Strips were applied and the patient was taken to recovery in stable condition.  She tolerated the procedure well.  She will be discharged from recovery when stable.  She is to resume her regular dialysis schedule and present for dialysis tomorrow."
153, Neurologic consultation was requested to evaluate her seizure medication and lethargy., Neurologic Consultation ,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION: , Neurologic consultation was requested by Dr. X to evaluate her seizure medication and lethargy.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is well known to me.  She has symptomatic partial epilepsy secondary to a static encephalopathy, cerebral palsy, and shunted hydrocephalus related to prematurity.  She also has a history of factor V Leiden deficiency.  She was last seen at neurology clinic on 11/16/2007.  At that time, instructions were given to mom to maximize her Trileptal dose if seizures continue.  She did well on 2 mL twice a day without any sedation.  This past Friday, she had a 25-minute seizure reportedly.  This consisted of eye deviation, unresponsiveness, and posturing.  Diastat was used and which mom perceived was effective.  Her Trileptal dose was increased to 3 mL b.i.d. yesterday.,According to mom since her shunt revision on 12/18/2007, she has been sleepier than normal.  She appeared to be stable until this past Monday about six days ago, she became more lethargic and had episodes of vomiting and low-grade fevers.  According to mom, she had stopped vomiting since her hospitalization.  Reportedly, she was given a medication in the emergency room.  She still is lethargic, will not wake up spontaneously.  When she does awaken however, she is appropriate, and interacts with them.  She is able to eat well; however her overall p.o. intake has been diminished.  She has also been less feisty as her usual sounds.  She has been seizure free since her admission.,LABORATORY DATA: , Pertinent labs obtained here showed the following:  CRP is less than 0.3, CMP normal, and CBC within normal limits.  CSF cultures so far is negative.  Dr. Limon's note refers to a CSF, white blood cell count of 2, 1 RBC, glucose of 55, and protein of 64.  There are no imaging studies in the computer.  I believe that this may have been done at Kaweah Delta Hospital and reviewed by Dr. X, who indicated that there was no evidence of shunt malfunction or infection.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , Trileptal 180 mg b.i.d., lorazepam 1 mg p.r.n., acetaminophen, and azithromycin.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL:  The patient was asleep, but easily aroused.  There was a brief period of drowsiness, which she had some jerky limb movements, but not seizures.  She eventually started crying and became agitated.  She made attempts to sit by bending her neck forward.  Fully awake, she sucks her bottle eagerly.,HEENT:  She was obviously visually impaired.  Pupils were 3 mm, sluggishly reactive to light.,EXTREMITIES:  Bilateral lower extremity spasticity was noted.  There was increased flexor tone in the right upper extremity.  IV was noted on the left hand.,ASSESSMENT:  ,Seizure breakthrough due to intercurrent febrile illness.  Her lethargy could be secondary to a viral illness with some component of medication effect since her Trileptal dose was increased yesterday and these are probable explanations if indeed shunt malfunction has been excluded.,I concur with Dr. X's recommendations.  I do not recommend any changes in Trileptal for now.  I will be available while she remains hospitalized.,"

This morning, her BNP was 163 at admission.  Her admission chest x-ray was unremarkable and did not show evidence of cardiomegaly to suggest pericardial effusion.  Her current EKG tracing from 05:42 shows a sinus bradycardia with Wolff-Parkinson White Pattern, a rate of 58 beats per minute, and a corrected QT interval of 557 milliseconds.  Her PR interval was 0.12.,We received a call from Munson Medical Center that a bed had been arranged for the patient.  I contacted Dr. Varner and we reviewed the patient's managed to this point.  All combined impression is that the patient was likely to not have had actual ventricular tachycardia.  This is based on her EP study from October showing her to be non-inducible.  In addition, she had a cardiac catheterization that showed no evidence of coronary artery disease.  What is most likely that the patient has postoperative atrial fibrillation.  Her WPW may have degenerated into a ventricular tachycardia, but this is unlikely.  At this point, we will convert the patient from IV amiodarone to oral amiodarone and obtain an echocardiogram to verify that she does not have evidence of pericardial effusion in the postoperative period.  I will recheck her potassium, magnesium, calcium, and phosphorus at this point and make adjustments if indicated.

She wishes to proceed with arthroplasty at this time.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the Operative Suite at ABCD General Hospital on 09/11/03.  She was placed on the operating table.  Department of Anesthesia administered a spinal anesthetic.  Once adequately anesthetized, the left lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  An Esmarch was applied and a tourniquet was inflated to 325 mmHg on the left thigh.  A longitudinal incision was made over the anterior portion of the knee and this was taken down through the subcutaneous tissue to the level of the patella retinaculum.  A medial peripatellar arthrotomy was then made and taken down to the level of the tibial tubercle.  Care was then ensured that the patellar tendon was not violated.  The proximal tibia was then skeletonized both medially and laterally to the level of the axis through the joint line.  Again care was ensured that the patellar tendon was not avulsed from the insertion on the tibia.  The intramedullary canal was then opened using a drill and the anterior sizing guide was then placed.  Rongeur was used to take out any osteophytes and the size of approximately size E. At this point, the epicondyle axis guide was then inserted and aligned in a proper orientation.  The anterior cutting guide was then placed.  Care was checked for the amount of resection that the femur would be notched and the oscillating saw was used to cut the anterior portion of the femur.  After this was performed, this was removed and the distal femoral cutting guide was then placed.  The left knee placed in 5 degrees of valgus, guide was then placed, and a standard distal cut was then taken.  After the cuts were ensured further to be leveled and they were, and we proceeded to place the finishing guide size E and distal femur.  This was placed slightly in lateral position and secured in position with spring tense and head lift tense.  Once adequately secured and placed in the appropriate orientation, the alignment was again verified with the epicondyle axis and appeared to be externally rotated appropriately.  The chamfer cuts and anterior and posterior cuts were then made as well as the notch cut using the reciprocating and oscillating saws.  After this was performed, the guide was removed and all bony fragments were then removed.  Attention was then directed to the tibia.  The external tibial alignment guide was then placed and pinned to the proximal tibia in a proper position.  Care was ensured if it is was a varus or valgus and the appropriate.  The femur gauge was then used to provide us appropriate amount of bony resection.  This was then pinned and secured into place.  Ligament retractors were used to protect the collateral ligaments and the tip proximal tibial cut was then made.  This bony portion was then removed and remaining meniscal fragments were removed as well as the ACL till adequate exposure was obtained.  Trial components were then inserted into position and taken the range of motion and found to have good and full excellent range of motion stability.  The trial components were then removed.  The tibia was then stemmed in standard fashion after the tibial plate was placed in some degree of external rotation with appropriate alignment.  After it was stemmed and broached, these were removed and the patella was then incised, a size 41 patella reamer blade was then used and was taken down, a size 38 patella button was then placed intact.  Again the trial components were placed back into position.  Patella button was placed and the tracking was evaluated.  They tracked centrally with no touch technique.  Again, all components were now removed and the knee was then copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  Once adequately suctioned dry, the tibial portion was cemented and packed into place.  Also excess cement was removed.  The femoral component was then cemented into position.  All excess cement was removed.  A size 12 poly was then inserted in trial to provide compression at cement adhered.  The patella was then cemented and held into place.  All components were held under compression until cement had adequately adhered all excess cement was then removed.  The knee was then taken through range of motion and size 12 felt to be slightly too big, this was removed and the size 10 trial was replaced, and again had excellent varus and valgus stability with full range of motion and felt to be the articulate surface of choice.  The knee was again copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  One last check in the posterior aspect of the knee for any loose bony fragments or osteophytes was performed, there were none found and a final articulating surface was impacted and locked into place.  After this, the knee was taken again for final range of motion and found to have excellent position, stability, and good alignment of the components.  The knee was once again copiously irrigated, and the tourniquet was deflated.  Bovie cautery was used to cauterize the knee bleeding that was seen until good hemostasis obtained.  A drain was then placed deep to the retinaculum and the retinaculum repair was performed using #2-0 Ethibond and oversewn with a #1 Vicryl.  This was flexed and the repair was found held securely.  At this point, the knee was again copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  The subcutaneous tissue was closed with #2-0 Vicryl, and the skin was approximated with skin staples.  Sterile dressing with Adaptic, 4x4s, ABDs, and Kerlix rolls was then applied.  The patient was then transferred back to the gurney in a supine position.,DISPOSITION: , The patient tolerated well with no complications, to PACU in satisfactory condition."

Excision of plantar ulceration of the left fifth digit 3 cm x 1 cm in size.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient is a 38-year-old female with longstanding complaint of painful hammertoe deformity of her left fifth toe.  The patient had developed ulceration plantarly after being scheduled for removal of a plantar mass in the same area.  The patient elects for surgical removal of this ulceration and correction of her hammertoe deformity at this time.,After an IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was escorted to the OR where the patient was placed on the Operating Room table in the supine position.  After adequate amount of IV sedation was administered by Anesthesia Department, the patient was given a digital block to the left fifth toe using 0.5% Marcaine plain with 1% lidocaine plain in 1:1 mixture totaling 6 cc.  Following this, the patient was draped and prepped in a normal sterile orthopedic manner.  An ankle tourniquet was placed on the left ankle and the left foot was elevated and Esmarch bandage applied to exsanguinate the foot.  The ankle tourniquet was then inflated to 230 mmHg and then was brought back down to the level of the table.  The stockinette was then cut and reflected and held in place using towel clamp.,The skin was then cleansed using the wet and dry Ray-Tec sponge and then the plantar lesion was outlined.  The lesion measured 1 cm in diameter at the level of the skin and a 3 cm elliptical incision line was drawn on the surface of the skin in the plantolateral aspect of the left fifth digit.  Then using a fresh #15 blade, skin incision was made.  Following this, the incision was then deepened using a fresh #15 blade down to the level of the subcutaneous tissue.  Using a combination of sharp and blunt dissection, the skin was reflected distally and proximally to the lesion.  The lesion appeared well encapsulated with fibrous tissue and through careful dissection using combination of sharp and drill instrumentation the ulceration was removed in its entirety.  The next further exploration was performed to ensure that no residual elements of the fibrous capsular tissue remained within.  The lesion extended from the level of the skin down to the periosteal tissue of the middle and distal phalanx, however, did not show any evidence of extending beyond the level of a periosteum.  Remaining tissues were inspected and appeared healthy.  The lesion was placed in the specimen container and sent to pathology for microanalysis as well as growth.  Attention was then directed to the proximal interphalangeal joint of the left fifth digit and using further dissection with a #15 blade, the periosteum was reflected off the lateral aspect of the proximal ________ median phalanx.  The capsule was also reflected to expose the prominent lateral osseous portion of this joint.  Using a sagittal saw and #139 blade, the lateral osseous prominence was resected.  This was removed in entirety.  Then using power-oscillating rasp, the sharp edges were smoothed and recontoured to the desirable anatomic condition.  Then the incision and wound was flushed using copious amounts of sterile saline with gentamycin.  Following this, the bone was inspected and appeared to be healthy with no evidence of involvement from the removed aforementioned lesion.,Following this, using #4-0 nylon in a combination of horizontal mattress and simple interrupted sutures, the lesion wound was closed and skin was approximated well without tension to the surface skin.  Following this, the incision site was dressed using Owen silk, 4x4s, Kling, and Coban in a normal fashion.  The tourniquet was then deflated and hyperemia was noted to return to digits one through five of the left foot.  The patient was then escorted from the operative table into the Postanesthesia Care Unit.  The patient tolerated the procedure and anesthesia well and was brought to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact.  In the recovery, the patient was given a surgical shoe as well as given instructions for postoperative care to include rest ice and elevation as well as the patient was given prescription for Naprosyn 250 mg to be taken three times daily as well as Vicodin ES to be taken q.6h. as needed.,The patient will follow-up on Friday with Dr. X in office for further evaluation.  The patient was also given instructions as to signs of infection and to monitor her operative site.  The patient was instructed to keep daily dressings intact, clean, dry, and to not remove them."

Local anesthesia was administered in the common femoral artery and using ultrasound guidance, the common femoral artery was accessed.  Guidewire was threaded followed by a ,4-French sheath.  Through the 4-French sheath a 4-French Omni flush catheter was placed.  The glidewire was removed and contrast administered to identify the level of the renal artery.  Using power injector an aortogram proceeded.,The catheter was then pulled down to the aortic bifurcation.  A timed run-off view of both legs was performed and due to a very abnormal and delayed run-off in the left, I opted to perform an angiogram of the left lower extremity with an isolated approach.  The catheter was pulled down to the aortic bifurcation and using a glidewire, I obtained access to the contralateral left external iliac artery.  The Omni flush catheter was advanced to the left distal external iliac artery.  The glidewire rather exchanged for an Amplatz stiff wire.  This was left in place and the 4-French sheath removed and replaced with a 6-French destination 45-cm sheath.  This was advanced into the proximal superficial femoral artery and an angiogram performed.  I identified a functionally occluded distal superficial femoral artery and after obtaining views of the run off made plans for angioplasty.,The patient was given 5000 units of heparin and this was allowed to circulate.  A glidewire was carefully advanced using Roadmapping techniques through the functionally occluded blood vessels.  A 4-mm x 4-cm angioplasty balloon was used to dilate the area in question.,Final views after dilatation revealed a dissection.  A search for a 5-mm stent was performed, but none of this was available.  For this reason, I used a 6-mm x 80-mm marked stent and placed this at the distal superficial femoral artery.  Post dilatation was performed with a 4-mm angioplasty balloon.  Further views of the left lower extremity showed irregular change in the popliteal artery.  No significant stenosis could be identified in the left popliteal artery and noninvasive scan.  For this reason, I chose not to treat any further areas in the left leg.,I then performed closure of the right femoral artery with a 6-French Angio-Seal device.  Attention was turned to the left femoral artery and local anesthesia administered.  Access was obtained with the ultrasound and the femoral artery identified.  Guidewire was threaded followed by a 4-French sheath.  This was immediately exchanged for the 6-French destination sheath after the glidewire was used to access the distal external iliac artery.  The glidewire was exchanged for the Amplatz stiff wire to place the destination sheath.  The destination was placed in the proximal superficial femoral artery and angiogram obtained.  Initial views had been obtained from the right femoral sheath before removal.,Views of the right superficial femoral artery demonstrated significant stenosis with accelerated velocities in the popliteal and superficial femoral artery.  For this reason, I performed the angioplasty of the superficial femoral artery using the 4-mm balloon.  A minimal dissection plane measuring less than 1 cm was identified at the proximal area of dilatation.  No further significant abnormality was identified.  To avoid placing a stent in the small vessel I left it alone and approached the popliteal artery.  A 3-mm balloon was chosen to dilate a 50 to 79% popliteal artery stenosis.  Reasonable use were obtained and possibly a 4-mm balloon could have been used.  However, due to her propensity for dissection I opted not to.  I then exchanged the glidewire for an O1 for Thruway guidewire using an exchange length.  This was placed into the left posterior tibial artery.  A 2-mm balloon was used to dilate the orifice of the posterior tibial artery.  I then moved the wire to the perineal artery and dilated the proximal aspect of this vessel.  Final images showed improved run-off to the right calf.  The destination sheath was pulled back into the left external iliac artery and an Angio-Seal deployed.,FINDINGS: , Aortogram demonstrates a dual right renal artery with the inferior renal artery supplying the lower one third of the right renal parenchyma.  No evidence of renal artery stenosis is noted bilaterally.  There is a single left renal artery.  The infrarenal aorta, both common iliac and the external iliac arteries are normal.  On the right, a superficial femoral artery is widely patent and normal proximally.  At the distal third of the thigh there is diffuse disease with moderate stenosis noted.  Moderate stenosis is also noted in the popliteal artery and single vessel run-off through the posterior tibial artery is noted.  The perineal artery is functionally occluded at the midcalf.  The dorsal pedal artery filled by collateral at the high ankle level.,On the left, the proximal superficial femoral artery is patent.  Again, at the distal third of the thigh, there is a functional occlusion of the superficial femoral artery with poor collateralization to the high popliteal artery.  This was successfully treated with angioplasty and a stent placement.  The popliteal artery is diffusely diseased without focal stenosis.  The tibioperoneal trunk is patent and the anterior tibial artery occluded at its orifice.,IMPRESSION,1.  Normal bilateral renal arteries with a small accessory right renal artery.,2.  Normal infrarenal aorta as well as normal bilateral common and external iliac arteries.,3.  The proximal right renal artery is normal with moderately severe stenosis in the superficial femoral popliteal and tibial arteries.  Successful angioplasty with reasonable results in the distal superficial femoral, popliteal and proximal posterior tibial artery as described.,4.  Normal proximal left superficial femoral artery with functional occlusion of the distal left superficial femoral artery successfully treated with angioplasty and stent placement.  Run-off to the left lower extremity is via a patent perineal and posterior tibial artery."

162, A 74-year-old woman for Cardiology consultation regarding atrial fibrillation and anticoagulation after a fall.  The patient denies any chest pain nor clear shortness of breath., Atrial Fibrillation - Consult ,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  I was kindly asked to see Ms. ABC who is a 74-year-old woman for cardiology consultation regarding atrial fibrillation and anticoagulation after a fall.,The patient is somnolent at this time, but does arouse, but is unable to provide much history.  By review of the chart, it appears that she fell, which is what she states when she got up out of a rocking chair and could not get herself off the floor.  She states that 1-1/2 hours later she was able to get herself off the floor.,The patient denies any chest pain nor clear shortness of breath.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Includes, end-stage renal disease from hypertension.  She follows up with Dr. X in her office and has been known to have a small-to-moderate sized pericardial effusion since 11/07 that has apparently been followed and it appears that the patient was not interested in having diagnostic pericardiocentesis done.  She had an echocardiogram today (please see also that report), which shows stable and small-to-moderate sized pericardial effusion without tamponade, normal left ventricular ejection fraction at 55% with mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, mildly dilated right ventricular size, normal right ventricular ejection fraction, moderate mitral regurgitation and severe tricuspid regurgitation with severe pulmonary hypertension, estimated PA systolic pressure of 71 mmHg when compared to the prior echocardiogram done 08/29/07, previously the mitral regurgitation was mild and previously the PA systolic pressure was estimated at 90 mmHg.  Other findings were not significantly changed including pericardial effusion description.  She has a history of longstanding hypertension.  She has been on hemodialysis since 1997 for renal failure, history of mini-strokes documented several years ago, history of seizure disorder, she has a history of right upper extremity edema and right breast enlargement from right subclavian vein occlusion.  She has a history of hypertension, depression, hyperlipidemia, on Sensipar for tertiary hyperparathyroidism.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: , Includes, cholecystectomy, post fistula in the left arm, which has failed, and right arm, which is being used including number of operative procedures to the fistula.

Sertraline 100 mg p.o. nightly.,10.  Zocor 20 mg p.o. nightly.,ALLERGIES: , TO MEDICATIONS PER CHART ARE NONE.,FAMILY HISTORY:  ,Unable to obtain as the patient becomes quite sleepy when I am talking.,SOCIAL HISTORY:  ,Unable to obtain as the patient becomes quite sleepy when I am talking.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , Unable to obtain as the patient becomes quite sleepy when I am talking.,PHYSICAL EXAM:  ,Temperature 99.2, blood pressure ranges from 88/41 to 108/60, pulse 70, respiratory rate, 20, O2 saturation 98%.  Height is 5 feet 1 inch, weight 147 pounds.  On general exam, she is a pleasant elderly woman who does arouse to voice, but then becomes quite sleepy and apparently that is an improvement from when she was admitted.  HEENT shows the cranium is normocephalic and atraumatic.  She has moist mucosal membranes.  Neck veins are difficult to assess, but do not appear clinically distended.  No carotid bruits.  Lungs are clear to auscultation anteriorly.  No wheezes.  Cardiac exam:  S1, S2 regular rate, 3/6 holosystolic murmur heard with radiation from the left apex towards the left axilla.  No rub, no gallop.  PMI is nondisplaced.  Abdomen:  Soft, nondistended.  CVA is benign.  Extremities with no significant edema.  Pulses appear grossly intact.  She has evidence of right upper extremity edema, which is apparently chronic.,DIAGNOSTIC DATA/LAB DATA: , EKGs are reviewed including from 07/07/09 at 08:31 a.m., which shows atrial fibrillation with left anterior fascicular block, poor R-wave progression when compared to one done on 07/06/09 at 18:25, there is really no significant change.  The atrial fibrillation appears present since at least on EKG done on 11/02/07 and this EKG is not significantly changed from the most recent one.  Echocardiogram results as above.  Chest x-ray shows mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  BNP shows 3788.  Sodium 136, potassium 4.5, chloride 94, bicarbonate 23, BUN 49, creatinine 5.90.  Troponin was 0.40 followed by 0.34.  INR 1.03 on 05/18/07.  White blood cell count 9.4, hematocrit 42, platelet count 139.,IMPRESSION: , Ms. ABC is a 74-year-old woman admitted to the hospital with a fall and she has a history of vascular dementia, so her history is somewhat unreliable it seems and she is somnolent at that time.  She does have chronic atrial fibrillation again documented at least present since 2007 and I found an EKG report by Dr. X, which shows atrial fibrillation on 08/29/07 per her report.  One of the questions we were asked was whether the patient would be a candidate for Coumadin.  Clearly given her history of small mini-strokes, I think Coumadin would be appropriate given this chronic atrial fibrillation, but the main issue is the fall risk.  If not felt to be significant fall risk then I would strongly recommend Coumadin as the patient herself states that she has only fallen twice in the past year.  I would defer that decision to Dr. Z and Dr. XY who know the patient well and it may be that physical therapy consult is appropriate to help adjudicate.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,1.  Fall assessment as per Dr. Z and Dr. XY with possible PT consult if felt appropriate and if the patient is not felt to be at significant fall risk, would put her on Coumadin.  Given her history of small strokes as documented in the chart and her chronic atrial fibrillation, she does have reasonable heart rate control on current labetalol.,2.  The patient has elevated BNP and I suspect that is due to her severe pulmonary hypertension and renal failure and in the light of normal LV function, I would not make any further evaluation of that other than aggressive diuresis.,3.  Regarding this minimal troponin elevation, I do not feel this is a diagnosis especially in the setting of pulmonary hypertension and her small-to-moderate sized stable pericardial effusion again that has been longstanding since 2007 from what I can tell and there is no evidence of tamponade.  I would defer to her usual cardiologist Dr. X whether an outpatient stress evaluation is appropriate for risk stratification.  I did find that the patient had a prior cardiac stress test in 08/07 where they felt that there was some subtle reversibility of the anterior wall, but it was felt that it may be artifact rather than true ischemia with normal LV function seen on that study as well.,4.  Continue Norvasc for history of hypertension as well as labetalol.,5.  The patient is felt to be a significant fall risk and will at least continue her aspirin 81 mg once a day for secondary CVA, thromboprophylaxis (albeit understanding that it is inferior to Coumadin).,6.  Continue Dilantin for history of seizures."

166, The patient was admitted approximately 3 days ago with increasing shortness of breath secondary to pneumonia.  Pulmonary Medicine Associates have been contacted to consult in light of the ICU admission. , Shortness Of Breath - Progress Note ,"She was evaluated this a.m. and was without any significant clinical change.  Her white count has been improving and down to 12,000.  A chest x-ray obtained today showed some bilateral infiltrates, but no acute cardiopulmonary change.  There was a suggestion of a bilateral lower lobe pneumonitis or pneumonia.,She has been on Zosyn for the infection.,Throughout her hospitalization, we have been trying to adjust her pain medications.  She states that the methadone did not work for her.  She was ""immune"" to oxycodone.  She had been on tramadol before and was placed back on that.  There was some question that this may have been causing some dizziness.  She also was on clonazepam and alprazolam for the underlying bipolar disorder.,Apparently, her husband was in this afternoon.  He had a box of her pain medications.  It is unclear whether she took a bunch of these or precisely what happened.  I was contacted that she was less responsive.  She periodically has some difficulty to arouse due to pain medications, which she has been requesting repeatedly, though at times does not appear to have objective signs of ongoing pain.  The nurse found her and was unable to arouse her at this point.  There was a concern that she had taken some medications from home.  She was given Narcan and appeared to come around some.  Breathing remained somewhat labored and she had some diffuse scattered rhonchi, which certainly changed from this a.m.  Additional Narcan was given as well as some medications to reverse a possible benzodiazepine toxicity.  With O2 via mask, oxygenation was stable at 90% to 95% after initial hypoxia was noted.  A chest x-ray was obtained at this time.  An ECG was obtained, which shows a sinus tachycardia, noted to have ischemic abnormalities.,In light of the acute decompensation, she was then transferred to the ICU.  We will continue the IV Zosyn.  Respiratory protocol with respiratory management.  Continue alprazolam p.r.n., but avoid if she appears sedated.  We will attempt to avoid additional pain medications, but we will continue with the Dilaudid for time being.  I suspect she will need something to control her bipolar disorder.,Pulmonary Medicine Associates have been contacted to consult in light of the ICU admission.  At this juncture, she does not appear to need an intubation.  Pending chest x-ray, she may require additional IV furosemide."

Excision of tumor from the skull with debridement of the superficial cortex with diamond bur.  Advancement flap closure, with total undermined area 18 centimeters by 16 centimeters (CPT 14300).,ANESTHESIA:,  General endotracheal anesthesia.,INDICATIONS:  ,This is an 81-year-old male who has a large exophytic 7cm lesion of the anterior midline scalp which is biopsy-positive for skin malignancy, specifically, squamous call carcinoma.  This appears to be affixed to the underlying scalp.,PLAN: , Radical resection with frozen sections to clear margins thereafter, with planned reconstruction.,CONSENT:,  I have discussed with the patient the possible risks of bleeding, infection, renal problems, scar formation, injury to muscle, nerves, and possible need for additional surgery with possible recurrence of the patient's carcinoma, with review of detailed informed consent with the patient, who understood, and wished to proceed.,FINDINGS: , The patient had a 7cm large exophytic lesion which appeared to be invasive into the superficial table of the skull.  The final periosteal margin which centrally appeared was positive for carcinoma.  The final margins peripherally were all negative.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the operating room and there was placed supine on the operating room table.,General endotracheal anesthesia was administered after endotracheal tube intubation was performed by the Anesthesia Service personnel.  The patient was thereafter prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner using Betadine Scrub and Betadine paint.  Thereafter, the local anesthesia was injected into the area around the tumor.  A **** type excision was planned down to the periosteum.  A supraperiosteal radical resection was performed.,It was obvious that there was tumor at the deep margin, involving the periosteum.  The edges were marked along the four quadrants, at the 12 o'clock, 3 o'clock, 6 o'clock, and the 9 o'clock positions, and these were sent for frozen section evaluation.  Frozen section revealed positive margins at one end of the resection.  Therefore, an additional circumferential resection was performed and the final margins were all negative.,Following completion, the deep periosteal margin was resected.  The circumferential periosteal margins were noted to be negative; however, centrally, there was a small area which showed tumor eroding into the superficial cortex of the skull.  Therefore, the Midas Rex drill was utilized to resect approximately 1-2 mm of the superficial cortex of the bone at the area where the positive margin was located.  Healthy bone was obtained; however, it did not enter the diploic or marrow-containing bone in the area.  Therefore, no bong margin was taken.  However, at the end of the procedure, it did not appear that the residual bone had any residual changes consistent with carcinoma.,Following completion of the bony resection, the area was irrigated with copious amounts of saline.  Thereafter, advancement flaps were created, both on the left and the right side of the scalp, with the total undermined area being approximately 18cm by 16cm.  The galea was incised in multiple areas, to provide for additional mobilization of the tissue.  The tissue was closed under tension with 3-0 Vicryl suture deep in the galea and surgical staples superficially.,The patient was awakened from anesthetic, was extubated and was taken to the recovery room in stable condition.,DISPOSITION:,  The patient was discharged to home with antibiotics and analgesics, to follow-up in approximately one week.,NOTE: , The final margins of both periosteal, as well as skin were negative circumferentially, around the tumor.  The only positive margin was deep, which was a periosteal margin and bone underlying it was partially resected, as was indicated above."

Placement of SynchroMed infusion pump.,2.  Tunneling of SynchroMed infusion pump catheter,3.  Anchoring of the intrathecal catheter and connecting of the right lower quadrant SynchroMed pump catheter to the intrathecal catheter.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , Under general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient was placed in a lateral decubitus position.  The patient was prepped and draped in a sterile manner.  The intrathecal catheter was placed via a percutaneous approach by the pain management specialist at which point an incision was made adjacent to the needle containing the intrathecal catheter.  This incision was carried down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue to the paraspinous muscle fascia which was cleared around the entry point of the intrathecal catheter needle.  A pursestring suture of 3-0 Prolene was placed around the needle in the paraspinous muscle.  The needle was withdrawn.  The pursestring suture was tied to snug the tissues around the catheter and prevent cerebrospinal fluid leak.  The catheter demonstrated free flow of cerebrospinal fluid,throughout the RV procedure.  The catheter was anchored to the paraspinous muscle with an anchoring device using interrupted sutures of 3-0 Prolene.  Antibiotic irrigation and antibiotic soak sponge were placed into the wound, and the catheter was clamped to prevent persistent leakage of cerebrospinal fluid while the SynchroMed-pump pocket was created.  Then, I turned my attention to the anterior abdominal wall where an oblique incision was made and carried down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue to the external oblique fascia, which was freed from attachments to the overlying subcutaneous tissue utilizing blunt and sharp dissection with electrocautery.  A pocket was created that would encompass the SynchroMed fusion pump.  A tunneling device was then passed through the subcutaneous tissue from the back incision to the abdominal incision, and a SynchroMed pump catheter was placed to the tunneling device.  The tunneling device was then removed leaving the SynchroMed pump catheter extending from the anterior abdominal wall incision to the posterior back incision.  The intrathecal catheter was trimmed.  A clear plastic boot was placed over the intrathecal catheter, and the connecting device was advanced from the SynchroMed pump catheter into the intrathecal catheter connecting the 2 catheters together.  The clear plastic boot was then placed over the connection, and it was anchored in place with 0-silk ties.  Good CSF was then demonstrated flowing through the SynchroMed pump catheter.  The SynchroMed pump catheter was connected to the SynchroMed pump and anchored in place with a 0-silk tie.  Excess catheter was coiled and placed behind the pump.  The pump was placed into the subcutaneous pocket created for it on the anterior abdominal wall.  The pump was anchored to the anterior abdominal wall fascia with interrupted sutures of 2-0 Prolene; 4 of the sutures were placed.  The subcutaneous tissues were irrigated with normal saline.  The subcutaneous tissue of both wounds was closed with running suture of 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin of both wounds was closed with staples.  Antibiotic ointment and a sterile dressing were applied.  The patient was awake and taken to the recovery room.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was stable at the completion of the procedure.  All sponge and lap, needle and instrument counts were correct at the completion of the procedure."

172, Nissen fundoplication.   A 2 cm midline incision was made at the junction of the upper two-thirds and lower one-third between the umbilicus and the xiphoid process. , Nissen Fundoplication ,"PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Nissen fundoplication.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , After informed consent was obtained detailing the risks of infection, bleeding, esophageal perforation and death, the patient was brought to the operative suite and placed supine on the operating room table.  General endotracheal anesthesia was induced without incident.  The patient was then placed in a modified lithotomy position taking great care to pad all extremities.  TEDs and Venodynes were placed as prophylaxis against deep venous thrombosis.  Antibiotics were given for prophylaxis against surgical infection.,A 52-French bougie was placed in the proximal esophagus by Anesthesia, above the cardioesophageal junction.  A 2 cm midline incision was made at the junction of the upper two-thirds and lower one-third between the umbilicus and the xiphoid process.  The fascia was then cleared of subcutaneous tissue using a tonsil clamp.  A 1-2 cm incision was then made in the fascia gaining entry into the abdominal cavity without incident.  Two sutures of 0 Vicryl were then placed superiorly and inferiorly in the fascia, and then tied to the special 12 mm Hasson trocar fitted with a funnel-shaped adaptor in order to occlude the fascial opening.  Pneumoperitoneum was then established using carbon dioxide insufflation to a steady state of pressure of 16 mmHg.  A 30-degree laparoscope was inserted through this port and used to guide the remaining trocars.,The remaining trocars were then placed into the abdomen taking care to make the incisions along Langer's line, spreading the subcutaneous tissue with a tonsil clamp, and confirming the entry site by depressing the abdominal wall prior to insertion of the trocar.  A total of 4 other 10/11 mm trocars were placed.  Under direct vision 1 was inserted in the right upper quadrant at the midclavicular line, at a right supraumbilical position; another at the left upper quadrant at the midclavicular line, at a left supraumbilical position; 1 under the right costal margin in the anterior axillary line; and another laterally under the left costal margin on the anterior axillary line.  All of the trocars were placed without difficulty.  The patient was then placed in reverse Trendelenburg position.,The triangular ligament was taken down sharply, and the left lobe of the liver was retracted superolaterally using a fan retractor placed through the right lateral cannula.  The gastrohepatic ligament was then identified and incised in an avascular plane.  The dissection was carried anteromedially onto the phrenoesophageal membrane.  The phrenoesophageal membrane was divided on the anterior aspect of the hiatal orifice.  This incision was extended to the right to allow identification of the right crus.  Then along the inner side of the crus, the right esophageal wall was freed by dissecting the cleavage plane.,The liberation of the posterior aspect of the esophagus was started by extending the dissection the length of the right diaphragmatic crus.  The pars flaccida of the lesser omentum was opened, preserving the hepatic branches of the vagus nerve.  This allowed free access to the crura, left and right, and the right posterior aspect of the esophagus, and the posterior vagus nerve.,Attention was next turned to the left anterolateral aspect of the esophagus.  At its left border, the left crus was identified.  The dissection plane between it and the left aspect of the esophagus was freed.  The gastrophrenic ligament was incised, beginning the mobilization of the gastric pouch.  By dissecting the intramediastinal portion of the esophagus, we elongated the intra-abdominal segment of the esophagus and reduced the hiatal hernia.,The next step consisted of mobilization of the gastric pouch.  This required ligation and division of the gastrosplenic ligament and several short gastric vessels using the harmonic scalpel.  This dissection started on the stomach at the point where the vessels of the greater curvature turned towards the spleen, away from the gastroepiploic arcade.  The esophagus was lifted by a Babcock inserted through the left upper quadrant port.  Careful dissection of the mesoesophagus and the left crus revealed a cleavage plane between the crus and the posterior gastric wall.  Confirmation of having opened the correct plane was obtained by visualizing the spleen behind the esophagus.  A one-half inch Penrose drain was inserted around the esophagus and sewn to itself in order to facilitate retraction of the distal esophagus.  The retroesophageal channel was enlarged to allow easy passage of the antireflux valve.,The 52-French bougie was then carefully lowered into the proximal stomach, and the hiatal orifice was repaired.  Two interrupted 0 silk sutures were placed in the diaphragmatic crura to close the orifice.,The last part of the operation consisted of the passage and fixation of the antireflux valve.  With anterior retraction on the esophagus using the Penrose drain, a Babcock was passed behind the esophagus, from right to left.  It was used to grab the gastric pouch to the left of the esophagus and to pull it behind, forming the wrap.  The,52-French bougie was used to calibrate the external ring.  Marcaine 0.5% was injected 1 fingerbreadth anterior to the anterior superior iliac spine and around the wound for postanesthetic pain control.  The skin incision was approximated with skin staples.  A dressing was then applied.  All surgical counts were reported as correct.,Having tolerated the procedure well, the patient was subsequently taken to the recovery room in good and stable condition."
173," Pulmonary valve stenosis, supple pulmonic narrowing, and static encephalopathy", Pulmonary Valve Stenosis ,"HISTORY: , The patient is a 19-year-old boy with a membranous pulmonary atresia, underwent initial repair 12/04/1987 consisting of pulmonary valvotomy and placement of 4 mm Gore-Tex shunt between the ascending aorta and pulmonary artery with a snare.  This was complicated by shunt thrombosis __________ utilizing a 10-mm balloon.  Resulting in significant hypoxic brain injury where he has been left with static encephalopathy and cerebral palsy.  On 04/07/1988, he underwent heart catheterization and balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty utilizing a 10-mm balloon.  He has been followed conservatively since that time.  A recent echocardiogram demonstrated possibly a significant right ventricle outflow tract obstruction with tricuspid valve regurgitation velocity predicting a right ventricular systolic pressure in excess of 180 mmHg.  Right coronary artery to pulmonary artery fistula was also appreciated.  The patient underwent cardiac catheterization to assess hemodynamics associated with his current state of repair.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was placed under general endotracheal anesthesia breathing on 30% oxygen throughout the case.  Cardiac catheterization was performed as outlined in the attached continuation sheets.  Vascular entry was by percutaneous technique, and the patient was heparinized.  Monitoring during the procedure included continuous surface ECG, continuous pulse oximetry, and cycled cuff blood pressures, in addition to intravascular pressures.,Using a 7-French sheath, a 6-French wedge catheter was inserted.  The right femoral vein advanced through the right heart structures out to the branch pulmonary arteries.  This catheter was then exchanged over wire for a 5-French marker pigtail catheter, which was directed into the main pulmonary artery.,Using a 5-French sheath, a 5-French pigtail catheter was inserted in the right femoral artery and advanced retrograde to the descending aorta, ascending aorta, and left ventricle.  This catheter was then exchanged for a Judkins right coronary catheter for selective cannulation of the right coronary artery.,Flows were calculated by the Fick technique using a measured assumed oxygen consumption and contents derived from Radiometer Hemoximeter saturations and hemoglobin capacity.,Cineangiograms were obtained with injection of the main pulmonary artery and right coronary artery.,After angiography, two normal-appearing renal collecting systems were visualized.  The catheters and sheaths were removed and topical pressure applied for hemostasis.  The patient was returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  There were no complications.,DISCUSSION:,  Oxygen consumption was assumed to be normal.  Mixed venous saturation was normal with no evidence of intracardiac shunt.  Left-sided heart was fully saturated.  Phasic right atrial pressures were normal with an A-wave similar to the normal right ventricular end-diastolic pressure.  Right ventricular systolic pressure was mildly elevated at 45% systemic level.  There was a 25 mmHg peak systolic gradient across the outflow tract to the main branch pulmonary arteries.  Phasic branch pulmonary artery pressures were normal.  Right-to-left pulmonary artery capillary wedge pressures were normal with an A-wave similar to the normal left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 12 mmHg.  Left ventricular systolic pressure was systemic with no outflow obstruction to the ascending aorta.  Phasic ascending and descending pressures were similar and normal.  The calculated systemic and pulmonary flows were equal and normal.  Vascular resistances were normal.  Angiogram with contrast injection in the main pulmonary artery showed catheter induced pulmonary insufficiency.  The right ventricle appeared mildly hypoplastic with a good contractility and mild tricuspid valve regurgitation.  There is dynamic narrowing of the infundibulum with hypoplastic pulmonary annulus.  The pulmonary valve appeared to be thin and moved well.  The median branch pulmonary arteries were of good size with normal distal arborization.  Angiogram with contrast injection in the right coronary artery showed a non-dominant coronary with a small fistula arising from the proximal right coronary artery coursing over the infundibulum and entering the left facing sinus of the main pulmonary artery.,INITIAL DIAGNOSES:,1.

The FDS had a partial ulnar slip laceration and the FDP had a 25% transverse laceration as well.  The radial neurovascular bundle was found to be completely intact.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  All bony prominences were adequately padded.  Tourniquet was placed on the right upper extremity after being packed with Webril, but not inflated at this time.  The right upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The hand was inspected.  Palmar surface revealed approximally 0.5 cm laceration at the base of the right ring finger at the base of proximal phalanx, which was approximated with nylon suture.  The sutures were removed and the wound was explored.  It was found that the ulnar digital neurovascular bundle was 100% transected.  The radial neurovascular bundle on the right ring finger was found to be completely intact.  We explored the flexor tendon and found that there was a partial laceration of the ulnar slip of the FDS and a 25% laceration in a transverse fashion to the FDP.  We copiously irrigated the wound.  Repair was undertaken of the FDS with #3-0 undyed Ethibond suture.  The laceration of the FDP was not felt that it need to repair due to majority of the substance in the FDP was still intact.  Attention during our repair at the flexor tendon, the A1 pulley was incised for better visualization as well as better tendon excursion after repair.  Attention was then drawn to the ulnar digital bundle which has been transected prior during the injury.  The digital nerve was dissected proximally and distally to likely visualize the nerve.  The nerve was then approximated using microvascular technique with #8-0 nylon suture.  The hands were well approximated.  The nerve was not under undue tension.  The wound was then copiously irrigated and the skin was closed with #4-0 nylon interrupted horizontal mattress alternating with simple suture.  Sterile dressing was placed and a dorsal extension Box splint was placed.  The patient was transferred off of the bed and placed back on a gurney and taken to PACU in stable condition.

176, Right suboccipital craniectomy for resection of tumor using the microscope modifier 22 and cranioplasty., Suboccipital Craniectomy  ,"TITLE OF OPERATION: , Right suboccipital craniectomy for resection of tumor using the microscope modifier 22 and cranioplasty.,INDICATION FOR SURGERY: , The patient with a large 3.5 cm acoustic neuroma.  The patient is having surgery for resection.  There was significant cerebellar peduncle compression.  The tumor was very difficult due to its size as well as its adherence to the brainstem and the nerve complex.  The case took 12 hours.  This was more difficult and took longer than the usual acoustic neuroma.,PREOP DIAGNOSIS: , Right acoustic neuroma.,POSTOP DIAGNOSIS: , Right acoustic neuroma.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was brought to the operating room.  General anesthesia was induced in the usual fashion.  After appropriate lines were placed, the patient was placed in Mayfield 3-point head fixation, hold into a right park bench position to expose the right suboccipital area.  A time-out was settled with nursing and anesthesia, and the head was shaved, prescrubbed with chlorhexidine, prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  The incision was made and cautery was used to expose the suboccipital bone.  Once the suboccipital bone was exposed under the foramen magnum, the high speed drill was used to thin out the suboccipital bone and the craniectomy carried out with Leksell and insertion with Kerrison punches down to the rim of the foramen magnum as well as laterally to the edge of the sigmoid sinus and superiorly to the edge of the transverse sinus.  The dura was then opened in a cruciate fashion, the cisterna magna was drained, which nicely relaxed the cerebellum.  The dura leaves were held back with the 4-0 Nurolon.  The microscope was then brought into the field, and under the microscope, the cerebellar hemisphere was elevated.  Laterally, the arachnoid was very thick.  This was opened with bipolar and microscissors and this allowed for the cerebellum to be further mobilized until the tumor was identified.  The tumor was quite large and filled up the entire lateral aspect of the right posterior fossa.  Initially two retractors were used, one on the tentorium and one inferiorly.  The arachnoid was taken down off the tumor.  There were multiple blood vessels on the surface, which were bipolared.  The tumor surface was then opened with microscissors and the Cavitron was used to began debulking the lesion.  This was a very difficult resection due to the extreme stickiness and adherence to the cerebellar peduncle and the lateral cerebellum; however, as the tumor was able to be debulked, the edge began to be mobilized.  The redundant capsule was bipolared and cut out to get further access to the center of the tumor.  Working inferiorly and then superiorly, the tumor was taken down off the tentorium as well as out the 9th, 10th or 11th nerve complex.  It was very difficult to identify the 7th nerve complex.  The brainstem was identified above the complex.  Similarly, inferiorly the brainstem was able to be identified and cotton balls were placed to maintain this plain.  Attention was then taken to try identify the 7th nerve complex.  There were multitude of veins including the lateral pontine vein, which were coming right into this area.  The lateral pontine vein was maintained.  Microscissors and bipolar were used to develop the plain, and then working inferiorly, the 7th nerve was identified coming off the brainstem.  A number 1 and number 2 microinstruments were then used to began to develop the plane.  This then allowed for the further appropriate plane medially to be identified and cotton balls were then placed.  A number 11 and number 1 microinstrument continued to be used to free up the tumor from the widely spread out 7th nerve.  Cavitron was used to debulk the lesion and then further dissection was carried out.  The nerve stimulated beautifully at the brainstem level throughout this.  The tumor continued to be mobilized off the lateral pontine vein until it was completely off.  The Cavitron was used to debulk the lesion out back laterally towards the area of the porus.  The tumor was debulked and the capsule continued to be separated with number 11microinstrument as well as the number 1 microinstrument to roll the tumor laterally up towards the porus.  At this point, the capsule was so redundant, it was felt to isolate the nerve in the porus.  There was minimal bulk remaining intracranially.  All the cotton balls were removed and the nerve again stimulated beautifully at the brainstem.  Dr. X then came in and scrubbed into the case to drill out the porus and remove the piece of the tumor that was left in the porus and coming out of the porus.,I then scrubbed back into case once Dr. X had completed removing this portion of the tumor.  There was no tumor remaining at this point.  I placed some Norian in the porus to seal any air cells, although there were no palpated.  An intradural space was then irrigated thoroughly.  There was no bleeding.  The nerve was attempted to be stimulated at the brainstem level, but it did not stimulate at this time.  The dura was then closed with 4-0 Nurolons in interrupted fashion.  A muscle plug was used over one area.  Duragen was laid and strips over the suture line followed by Hemaseel.  Gelfoam was set over this and then a titanium cranioplasty was carried out.  The wound was then irrigated thoroughly.  O Vicryls were used to close the deep muscle and fascia, 3-0 Vicryl for subcutaneous tissue, and 3-0 nylon on the skin.,The patient was extubated and taken to the ICU in stable condition."

Repair of soft tissue subacromial decompression rotator cuff repair, right shoulder.", Arthroscopic SLAP lesion ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Rotator cuff tear, right shoulder.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Superior labrum anterior and posterior lesion (peel-back), right shoulder.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1.  Arthroscopy with arthroscopic SLAP lesion.,2.  Repair of soft tissue subacromial decompression rotator cuff repair, right shoulder.,SPECIFICATIONS: , The entire operative procedure was done in Inpatient Operating Suite, room #1 at ABCD General Hospital.  This was done under a interscalene block anesthetic and subsequent general anesthetic in the modified beachchair position.,HISTORY AND GROSS FINDINGS:  ,This is a 54-year-old white female suffering an increasing right shoulder pain for a few months prior to surgical intervention.  She had an injury to her right shoulder when she fell off a bike.  She was diagnosed preoperatively with a rotated cuff tear.,Intra-articularly besides we noted a large SLAP lesion, superior and posterior to the attachment of the glenoid labrum from approximately 12:30 back to 10:30.  This acted as a peel-back type of mechanism and was displaced into the joint beyond the superior rim of the glenoid.  This was an obvious avulsion into subchondral bone with bone exposed.  The anterior aspect had degenerative changes, but did not have evidence of avulsion.  The subscapular was noted to be intact.  On the joint side of the supraspinatus, there was noted to be a laminated type of tearing to the rotated cuff to the anterior and mid-aspect of the supraspinatus attachment.,This was confirmed subacromially.  The patient had a type-I plus acromion in outlet view and thus it was elected to not perform a subacromial decompression, but soft tissue release of the CA ligament in a releasing resection type fashion.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient was placed supine upon the operative table after she was given interscalene and then general anesthesia by the Anesthesia Department.  She was safely placed in a modified beachchair position.  She was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  The portals were created from outside the ends, posterior to the scope and anteriorly for an intraoperative portal and then laterally.  She had at least two other portals appropriate for both repair mechanisms described above.,Attention was then turned to the SLAP lesion.  The edges were debrided both on the bony side as well as soft tissue side.  We used the anterior portal to lift up the mechanism and created a superolateral portal through the rotator cuff and into the edge of the labrum.  Further debridement was carried out here.  A drill hole was made just on the articular surface superiorly for a knotless anchor.  A pull-through suture of #2 fiber wire was utilized with the ________.  This was pulled through.  It was tied to the leader suture of the knotless anchor.  This was pulled through and one limb of the anchor loop was grabbed and the anchor impacted with a mallet.  There was excellent fixation of the superior labrum.  It was noted to be solid and intact.  The anchor was placed safely in the bone.  There was no room for further knotless or other anchors.  After probing was carried out, hard copy Polaroid was obtained.,Attention was then turned to the articular side for the rotator cuff.  It was debrided.  Subchondral debridement was carried out to the tuberosity also.  Care was taken to go to the subchondral region but not beyond.  The bone was satisfactory.,Scope was then placed in the subacromial region.  Gross bursectomy was carried out with in the lateral portal.  This was done throughout as well as in the gutters anterolaterally and posteriorly.  Debridement was carried out further to the rotator cuff.  Two types of fixation were carried out, one with a superolateral portal a drill hole was made and anchor of the _knotless suture placed after PDS leader suture placed with a Caspari punch.  There was an excellent reduction of the tear posteriorly and then anteriorly.  Tendon to tendon repair was accomplished by placing a fiber wire across the tendon and tying sutured down through the anterolateral portal.  This was done with a sliding stitch and then two half stitches.  There was excellent reduction of the tear.,Attention was then turned to the CA ligament.  It was released along with periosteum and the undersurface of the anterior acromion.  The CA ligament was not only released but resected.  There was noted to be no evidence of significant spurring with only a mostly type-I acromion.  Thus, it was not elected to perform subacromial decompression for bone with soft tissue only.  A pain buster catheter was placed separately.  It was cut to length.  An interrupted #4-0 nylon was utilized for portal closure.  A 0.5% Marcaine was instilled subacromially.  Adaptic, 4x4s, ABDs, and Elastoplast tape placed for dressing.  The patient's arm was placed in a arm sling.  She was transferred to PACU in apparent satisfactory condition.  Expected surgical prognosis on this patient is fair."

There was some softening and loss of the articular cartilage over the glenoid.  The labrum was ________ attached permanently to the glenoid.  The biceps tendon was nonsubluxable.  Upon ranging of the shoulder in internal and external rotation showed no evidence of rotator cuff tear on the articular side.  Subacromial space did show excessive soft tissue causing some overstuffing of the subacromial space.  There was reconstitution of the bursa noted as well.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  This is a 51-year-old female had left shoulder pain of chronic nature who has had undergone prior rotator cuff debridement in May with partial pain relief and has had continued pain in the left shoulder.  MRI shows partial rotator cuff tear.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in a beachchair position.  After all bony prominences were adequately padded, the head was placed in the headholder with no excessive extension in the neck on flexion.  The left extremity was prepped and draped in usual fashion.  The #18 gauge needles were inserted into the left shoulder to locate the AC joint, the lateral aspect of the acromion as well as the pass of the first trocar to enter the shoulder joint from the posterior aspect.  We took an #11 blade scalpel and made a small 1-cm skin incision posteriorly approximately 4-cm inferior and medial to the lateral port of the acromion.  A blunt trocar was used to bluntly cannulate the joint and we put the camera into the shoulder at that point of the joint and instilled sterile saline to distend the capsule and begin our arthroscopic assessment of the shoulder.  A second port was established superior to the biceps tendon anteriorly under direct arthroscopic visualization using #11 blade on the skin and inserted bluntly the trocar and the cannula.  The operative findings found intra-articularly were as described previously gross operative findings.  We did not see any evidence of acute pathology.  We then removed all the arthroscopic instruments as well as the trocars and tunneled subcutaneously into the subacromial space and reestablished the portal and camera and inflow with saline.  The subacromial space was examined and found to have excessive soft tissue and bursa that was in the subacromial space that we debrided using arthroscopic shaver after establishing a lateral portal.  All this was done and hemostasis was achieved.  The rotator cuff was examined from the bursal side and showed no evidence of tears.  There was some fraying out laterally near its attachment over the greater tuberosity, which was debrided with the arthroscopic shaver.  We removed all of our instruments and suctioned the subacromial space dry.  A #4-0 nylon was used on the three arthroscopic portal and on the skin we placed sterile dressing and the arm was placed in an arm sling.  She was placed back on the gurney, extubated and taken to the PACU in stable condition."

He is almost 3 years old.  He presented with 2 months of irritability, vomiting, and increasing seizures.  CT scan was not conclusive, but shuntogram shows no flow through the shunt.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , After induction of general anesthesia, the patient was placed supine on the operating room table with his head turned to the left.  Scalp was clipped.  He was prepped on the head, neck, chest and abdomen with ChloraPrep.  Incisions were infiltrated with 0.5% Xylocaine with epinephrine 1:200,000.  He received oxacillin.,He was then reprepped and draped in a sterile manner.,The frontal incision was reopened and extended along the valve.  Subcutaneous sharp dissection with Bovie cautery was done to expose the shunt parts.  I separated the ventricular catheter from the valve, and this was a medium pressure small contour Medtronic valve.  There was some flow from the ventricular catheter, but not as much as I would expect.  I removed the right-angled clip with a curette and then pulled out the ventricular catheter, and there was gushing of CSF under high pressure.  So, I do believe that the catheter was obstructed, although inspection of the old catheter holes did not show any specific obstructions.  A new Codman BACTISEAL catheter was placed through the same hole.  I replaced it several times because I wanted to be sure it was in the cavity.  It entered easily and there was still just intermittent flow of CSF.  The catheter irrigated very well and seemed to be patent.,I tested the distal system with an irrigation filled feeding tube, and there was excellent flow through the distal valve and catheter.  So I did not think it was necessary to replace those at this time.  The new catheter was trimmed to a total length of 8 cm and attached to the proximal end of the valve.  The valve connection was secured to the pericranium with a #2-0 Ethibond suture.  The wound was irrigated with bacitracin irrigation.  The shunt pumped and refilled well.  The wound was then closed with #4-0 Vicryl interrupted galeal suture and Steri-Strips on the skin.  It was uncertain whether this will correct the problem or not, but we will continue to evaluate.  If his abdominal pressure is too high, then he may need a different valve.  This will be determined over time, but at this time, the shunt seemed to empty and refill easily.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  No complications.  Sponge and needle counts were correct.  Blood loss was minimal.  None replaced."

189, Posterior spinal fusion and spinal instrumentation.  Posterior osteotomy; posterior elements to include laminotomy-foraminotomy and decompression of the nerve roots., Spinal Fusion & Instrumentation ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Severe scoliosis.,ANESTHESIA: , General.  Lines were placed by Anesthesia to include an A line.,PROCEDURES: ,1.  Posterior spinal fusion from T2-L2.,2.  Posterior spinal instrumentation from T2-L2.,3.  A posterior osteotomy through T7-T8 and T8-T9.  Posterior elements to include laminotomy-foraminotomy and decompression of the nerve roots.,IMPLANT: , Sofamor Danek (Medtronic) Legacy 5.5 Titanium system.,MONITORING: , SSEPs, and the EPs were available.,INDICATIONS: , The patient is a 12-year-old female, who has had a very dysmorphic scoliosis.  She had undergone a workup with an MRI, which showed no evidence of cord abnormalities.  Therefore, the risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed with Surgery with the mother, to include infections, bleeding, nerve injuries, vascular injuries, spinal cord injury with catastrophic loss of motor function and bowel and bladder control.  I also discussed ___________ and need for revision surgery.  The mom understood all this and wished to proceed.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room and underwent general anesthetic.  She then had lines placed, and was then placed in a prone position.  Monitoring was then set up, and it was then noted that we could not obtain motor-evoked potentials.  The SSEPs were clear and were compatible with the preoperative, but no preoperative motors had been done, and there was a concern that possibly this could be from the result of the positioning.  It was then determined at that time, that we would go ahead and proceed to wake her up, and make sure she could move her feet.  She was then lightened under anesthesia, and she could indeed dorsiflex and plantarflex her feet, so therefore, it was determined to go ahead and proceed with only monitoring with the SSEPs.,The patient after being prepped and draped sterilely, a midline incision was made, and dissection was carried down.  The dissection utilized a combination of hand instruments and electrocautery and dissected out along the laminae and up to the transverse processes.  This occurred from T2-L2.  Fluoroscopy was brought in to verify positions and levels.  Once this was done, and all bleeding was controlled, retractors were then placed.  Attention was then turned towards placing screws first on the left side.  Lumbar screws were placed at the junction of the transverse process and the facets under fluoroscopic guidance.  The area was opened with a high speed burr, and then the track was defined with a blunt probe, and a ball-tipped feeler was then utilized to verify all walls were intact.  They were then tapped, and then screws were then placed.  This technique was used at L1 and L2, both the right and left.  At T12, a direct straight-ahead technique was utilized, where the facet was removed, and then the position was chosen under the fluoroscopy, and then it was spurred, the track was defined and then probed and tapped, and it was felt to be in good position.  Two screws, in the right and left were placed at T12 as well, reduction screws on the left.  The same technique was used for T11, where right and left screws were placed as well as T10 on the left.  At T9, a screw was placed on the left, and this was a reduction screw.  On the left at T8, a screw could not be placed due to the dysmorphic nature of the pedicle.  It was not felt to be intact; therefore, a screw was left out of this.  On the right, a thoracic screw was placed as well as at 7 and 6.  This was the dysmorphic portion of this.  Screws were attempted to be placed up, they could not be placed, so attention was then turned towards placing pedicle hooks.  Pedicle hooks were done by first making a box out of the pedicle, removing the complete pedicle, feeling the undersurface of the pedicle with a probe, and then seating the hook.  Upgoing pedicle hooks were placed at T3, T4, and T5.  A downgoing laminar hook was placed at the T7 level.  Screws had been placed at T6 and T7 on the right.  An upgoing pedicle hook was also placed at T3 on the right, and then, downgoing laminar hooks were placed at T2.  This was done by first using a transverse process, lamina finders to go around the transverse process and then ___________ laminar hooks.  Once all hooks were in place, spinal osteotomies were performed at T7-T8 and T8-T9.  This was the level of the kyphosis, to bring her back out of her kyphoscoliosis.  First the ligamentum flavum was resected using a large Kerrisons.  Next, the laminotomy was performed, and then a Kerrison was used to remove the ligamentum flavum at the level of the facet.  Once this was accomplished, a laminotomy was performed by removing more of the lamina, and to create a small wedge that could be closed down later to correct the kyphosis.  This was then brought out with resection of bone out to the foramen, doing a foraminotomy to free up the foramen on both sides.  This was done also between the T8-T9.  Once this was completed, Gelfoam was then placed.  Next, we observed, and measured and contoured.  The rods were then seated on the left, and then a derotation maneuver was performed.  Hooks had come loose, so the rod was removed on the left.  The hooks were then replaced, and the rod was reseated.  Again, it was derotated to give excellent correction.  Hooks were then well seated underneath, and therefore, they were then locked.  A second rod was then chosen on the right, and was measured, contoured, and then seated.  Next, once this was done, the rods were locked in the midsubstance, and then the downgoing pedicle hook, which had been placed at T7 was then helped to compress T8 as was the pedicle screw, and then this compressed the osteotomy sites quite nicely.  Next, distraction was then utilized to further correct at the spine, and to correct on the left, the left concave curve, which gave excellent correction.  On the right, compression was used to bring it down, and then, in the lower lumbar areas, distraction and compression were used to level out L2.  Once this was done, all screws were tightened.  Fluoroscopy was then brought in to verify L1 was level, and the first ribs were also level, and it gave a nice balanced spine.  Everything was copiously irrigated, ___________.  Next, a wake-up test was performed, and the patient was then noted to flex and extend the knees as well as dorsiflex and plantar flex both the feet.  The patient was then again sedated and brought back under general anesthesia.  Next, a high-speed burr was used for decortication.  After final tightening had been accomplished, and then allograft bone and autograft bone were mixed together with 10 mL of iliac crest aspirate and were placed into the wound.  The open canal areas had been protected with Gelfoam.  Once this was accomplished, the deep fascia was closed with multiple figure-of-eight #1's, oversewn with a running #1, _________ were then placed in the subcutaneous spaces which were then closed with 3-0 Vicryl, and then the skin was closed with 3-0 Monocryl and Dermabond.  Sterile dressing was applied.  Drains had been placed in the subcutaneous layer x2.  The patient during the case had no changes in the SSEPs, had a normal wake-up test, and had received Ancef and clindamycin during the case.  She was taken from the operating room in good condition."

I am bringing her back to the operating room for another exploration of this area and washout.  This will be the third procedure for this.  At the last time, there was gross purulence that was encountered.  Since that time, the patient has defervesced.  Her white count is slowly coming down.  Her C-reactive protein is slowly coming down.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  After informed consent was obtained, operative site marked, and after preoperative antibiotics were given, the patient was brought back to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table, where Anesthesia induced general anesthesia.  The patient's right lower extremity was prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion.  Surgical timeout occurred verifying the patient's identification, surgical site, surgical procedure, and administration of antibiotics.  The patient's previous incision sites had the sutures removed.  We bluntly dissected down through to the IT band.  These deep stitches were then removed.  We exposed the area of the subperiosteal abscess.  The tissue looked much better than at the last surgery.  We irrigated this area with three liters of saline containing bacitracin.  Next, we made our small medial window to assist with washout of the joint itself.  We put another three liters of saline containing bacitracin through the knee joint.  Lastly, we did another three liters into the area of the distal femur with three liters of plain saline.  We then placed two Hemovac drains, one in the metaphysis and one superficially.  We closed the deep fascia with #1 PDS.  Subcutaneous layers with 2-0 Monocryl and closed the skin with 2-0 nylon.  We placed a sterile dressing.  We then turned the case over to Dr. Petty for dressing change and skin graft.,PLAN:  ,Our plan will be to pull the drains in 48 hours.  We will then continue to watch the patient's fever curve and follow her white count to see how she is responding to the operative and medical therapies.,"

Informed consent was obtained. The patient received IV antibiotics including Ancef and Levaeuin prior to surgery. The patient was brought to the operating room and placud in the supine position, where (s)he wad prepped and draped in the routine fashion. A wire lid speculum was placed to provide exposure and 0.12 forceps and a Superblade were used to create a paracentesis at approximately 11 o'clock. Viscoat was injected through the paracentesis to fill the anterior chamber. The Viscoat cannula was used to sweep the incarcerated iris tissue from the wound. More Viscoat was injected to deepen the anterior chamber. A 10-0 nylon suture was used to place four sutures to close the corneal laceration. BSS was then injected to fill the anterior chamber and a small leak was noted at the inferior end of the wound. A fifth 10-0 nylon suture was then placed. The wound was packed and found to be watertight. The sutures were rotated, the wound was again checked and found to be watertight. A small amount of Viscoat was, again, injected to deepen the anterior chamber and the wound was swept to be sure there was no incarcerated uveal tissue. Several drops were placed in the XXX eye including Ocuflox, Pred Forte, Timolol 0.5%, Alphagan and Trusopt. An eye patch and shield were taped over the XXX eye. The patient was awakened from general anesthesia. (S)he was taken to the recovery area in good condition. There were no complications."

Then the anterior aspect of the neck was prepped and draped in a routine sterile fashion.  A linear skin incision was made in the skin fold line from just to the right of the midline to the leading edge of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle and taken sharply to platysma, which was dissected in a subplatysmal manner, and then the prevertebral space was encountered and prominent anterior osteophytes were well visualized once longus colli muscle was cauterized along its mesial border, and self-retaining retractors were placed to reveal the anterior osteophytic spaces.  Large osteophytes were excised with a rongeur at C4-5, C5-C6, and C6-C7 revealing a collapsed disc space and a #11 blade was utilized to create an annulotomy at all three interspaces with discectomies being performed with straight disc forceps removing grossly degenerated and very degenerated discs at C4-C5, then at C5-C6, then at C6-C7 sending specimen for permanent section to Pathology in a routine and separate manner.  Residual disc fragments were drilled away as drilling extended into normal cortical and cancellous elements in order to perform a wide decompression all the way posteriorly to the spinal canal itself finally revealing a ligament, which was removed in a similar piecemeal fashion with 1 and 2-mm micro Kerrison rongeurs also utilizing these instruments to remove prominent osteophytes, widely laterally bilaterally at each interspace with one at C4-C5, more right-sided.  The most prominent osteophyte and compression was at C5-C6 followed by C6-C7 and C4-C5 with a complete decompression of the spinal canal allowing the dura to finally bulge into the interspace at all three levels, once the ligaments were proximally removed as well and similarly a sign of a decompressed status.  The nerve roots themselves were inspected with a double ball dissector and found to be equally decompressed.  The wound was irrigated with antibiotic solution and hemostasis was well achieved with pledgets of Gelfoam subsequently irrigated away.  Appropriate size Bengal cages were filled with the patient's own bone elements and countersunk into position, filled along with fusion putty, and once these were quite tightly applied and checked, further stability was added by the placement of a Slim-LOC plate of appropriate size with appropriate size screws, and a post placement x-ray showed well-aligned elements.,The wound was irrigated with antibiotic solution again and inspected, and hemostasis was completely achieved and finally the wound was closed in a routine closure by approximation of the platysma with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl, and the skin with a subcuticular stitch of 4-0 Vicryl, and this was sterilely dressed, and incorporated a Penrose drain, which was carried from the prevertebral space externally to the skin wound and safety pin for security in a routine fashion.  At the conclusion of the case, all instruments, needle, and sponge counts were accurate and correct, and there were no intraoperative complications of any type."

X-rays as well as an MRI showed a severe arthritic presentation of the humeral head with mild arthrosis of the glenoid.  She had an intact rotator cuff being at a young age and with potential of glenoid thus it was felt that a hemi-resurfacing was appropriate for her right shoulder focusing in the humeral head.  All risks, benefits, expectations and complications of surgery were explained to her in detail including nerve and vessel damage, infection, potential for hardware failure, the need for revision surgery with potential of some problems even with surgical intervention.  The patient still wanted to proceed forward with surgical intervention.  The patient did receive 1 g of Ancef preoperatively.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating suite, placed in supine position on the operating table.  The Department of anesthesia administered a general endotracheal anesthetic, which the patient tolerated well.  The patient was moved to a beach chair position.  All extremities were well padded.  Her head was well padded to the table.  Her right upper extremity was draped in sterile fashion.  A saber incision was made from the coracoid down to the axilla.  Skin was incised down to the subcutaneous tissue, the cephalic vein was retracted as well as all neurovascular structures were retracted in the case.  Dissecting through the deltopectoral groove, the subscapularis tendon was found as well as the bicipital tendon, 1 finger breadth medial to the bicipital tendon an incision was made.  Subscapularis tendon was released.  The humeral head was brought in to; there were large osteophytes that were removed with an osteotome.  The glenoid then was evaluated and noted to just have mild arthrosis, but there was no need for surgical intervention in this region.  A sizer was placed.  It was felt that size 5 was appropriate for this patient, after which the guide was used to place the stem and pin.  This was placed, after which a reamer was placed along the humeral head and reamed to a size 5.  All extra osteophytes were excised.  The supraspinatus and infraspinatus tendons were intact.  Next, the excess bone was removed and irrigated after which reaming of the central portion of the humeral head was performed of which a trial was placed and showed that there was adequate fit and appropriate fixation.  The arm had excellent range of motion.  There are no signs of gross dislocation.  Drill holes were made into the humeral head after which a size 5 Copeland hemi-resurfacing component was placed into the humeral head, kept down in appropriate position, had excellent fixation into the humeral head.  Excess bone that had been reamed was placed into the Copeland metal component, after which this was tapped into position.  After which the wound site was copiously irrigated with saline and antibiotics and the humeral head was reduced and taken through range of motion; had adequate range of motion, full internal and external rotation as well as forward flexion and abduction.  There was no gross sign of dislocation.  Wound site once again it was copiously irrigated with saline antibiotics.  The subscapularis tendon was approximated back into position with #2 Ethibond after which the bicipital tendon did have significant tear to it; therefore it was tenodesed in to the pectoralis major tendon.

198," Patient seen initially with epigastric and right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, dizziness, and bloating.", Progress Note - Liver Cirrhosis ,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 55-year-old Hispanic male who was seen initially in the office February 15, 2006, with epigastric and right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, dizziness, and bloating.  The patient at that time stated that he had established diagnosis of liver cirrhosis.  Since the last visit the patient was asked to sign a lease of information form and we sent request for information from the doctor the patient saw before, Dr. X in Las Cruces and his primary care physician in Silver City, and unfortunately we did not get any information from anybody.  Also the patient had admission in Gila Medical Center with epigastric pain, diarrhea, and confusion.  He spent 3 days in the hospital.  He was followed by Dr. X and unfortunately we also do not have the information of what was wrong with the patient.  From the patient's report he was diagnosed with some kind of viral infection.  At the time of admission he had a lot of epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, and chills.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION,VITAL SIGNS:  Weight 107, height 6 feet 1 inch, blood pressure 128/67, heart rate 74, saturation 98%; pain is 3/10 with localization of the pain in the epigastric area.,HEENT:  PERRLA.  EOM intact.  Oropharynx is clear of lesions.,NECK:  Supple.  No lymphadenopathy.  No thyromegaly.,LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation and percussion bilateral.,CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.,ABDOMEN:  Not tender, not distended.  Splenomegaly about 4 cm under the costal margin.  No hepatomegaly.  Bowel sounds present.,MUSCULOSKELETAL:  No cyanosis, no clubbing, no pitting edema.,NEUROLOGIC:  Nonfocal.  No asterixis.  No costovertebral tenderness.,PSYCHE:  The patient is oriented x4, alert and cooperative.,LABORATORY DATA: , We were able to collect lab results from Medical Center; we got only CMP from the hospital which showed glucose level 79, BUN 9, creatinine 0.6, sodium 136, potassium 3.5, chloride 104, CO2 23.7, calcium 7.3, total protein 5.9, albumin 2.5, total bilirubin 5.63.  His AST 56, ALT 37, alkaline phosphatase 165, and his ammonia level was 53.  We do not have any other results back.  No hepatitis panels.  No alpha-fetoprotein level.  The patient told me today that he also got an ultrasound of the abdomen and the result was not impressive, but we do not have this result despite calling medical records in the hospital to release this information.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:,  The patient is a 55-year-old with established diagnosis of liver cirrhosis, unknown cause.,1.  Epigastric pain.  The patient had chronic pain syndrome, he had multiple back surgeries, and he has taken opiate for a prolonged period of time.  In the office twice the patient did not have any abdominal pain on physical exam.  His pain does not sound like obstruction of common bile duct and he had these episodes of abdominal pain almost continuously.  He probably requires increased level of pain control with increased dose of opiates, which should be addressed with his primary care physician.,2.  End-stage liver disease.  Of course, we need to find out the cause of the liver cirrhosis.  We do not have hepatitis panel yet and we do not have information about the liver biopsy which was performed before.  We do not have any information of any type of investigation in the past.  Again, patient was seen by gastroenterologist already in Las Cruces, Dr. X.  The patient was advised to contact Dr. X by himself to convince him to send available information because we already send release information form signed by the patient without any result.  It will be not reasonable to repeat unnecessary tests in that point in time.,We are waiting for the hepatitis panel and alpha-fetoprotein level.  We will also need to get information about ultrasound which was done in Gila Medical Center, but obviously no tumor was found on this exam of the liver.  We have to figure out hepatitis status for another reason if he needs vaccination against hepatitis A and B.  Until now we do not know exactly what the cause of the patient's end-stage liver disease is and my differential diagnosis probably is hepatitis C.  The patient denied any excessive alcohol intake, but I could not preclude alcohol-related liver cirrhosis also.  We will need to look for nuclear antibody if it is not done before.  PSC is extremely unlikely but possible.  Wilson disease also possible diagnosis but again, we first have to figure out if these tests were done for the patient or not.  Alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency will be extremely unlikely because the patient has no lung problem.  On his end-stage liver disease we already know that he had low platelet count splenomegaly.  We know that his bilirubin is elevated and albumin is very low.  I suspect that at the time of admission to the hospital the patient presented with encephalopathy.  We do not know if INR was checked to look for coagulopathy.  The patient had an EGD in 2005 as well as colonoscopy in Silver City.  We have to have this result to evaluate if the patient had any varices and if he needs any intervention for that.,At this point in time, I recommended the patient to continue to take lactulose 50 mL 3 times daily.  The patient tolerated it well; no diarrhea at this point in time.  I also recommended for him to contact his primary care physician for increased dose of opiates for him.  As a primary prophylaxis of GI bleeding in patient with end-stage liver disease we will try to use Inderal.  The patient got a prescription for 10 mg pills.  He will take 10 mg twice daily and we will gradually increase his dose until his heart rate will drop to 25% from 75% to probably 60-58.  The patient was educated how to use Inderal and he was explained why we decided to use this medication.  The patient will hold this medication if he is orthostatic or bradycardic.,Again, the patient and his wife were advised to contact all offices they have seen before to get information about what tests were already done and if on the next visit in 2 weeks we still do not have any information we will need to repeat all these tests I mentioned above.,We also discussed nutrition issues.  The patient was provided information that his protein intake is supposed to be about 25 g per day.  He was advised not to over-eat protein and advised not to starve.  He also was advised to stay away from alcohol.  His next visit is in 2 weeks with all results available."

200," Request for consultation to evaluate stomatitis, possibly methotrexate related.", Request For Consultation ,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION:, Please evaluate stomatitis, possibly methotrexate related.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:, The patient is a very pleasant 57-year old white female, a native of Cuba, being seen for evaluation and treatment of sores in her mouth that she has had for the last 10-12 days.  The patient has a long history of severe and debilitating rheumatoid arthritis for which she has had numerous treatments, but over the past ten years she has been treated with methotrexate quite successfully.  Her dosage has varied somewhere between 20 and 25 mg per week.  About the beginning of this year, her dosage was decreased from 25 mg to 20 mg, but because of the flare of the rheumatoid arthritis, it was increased to 22.5 mg per week.  She has had no problems with methotrexate as far as she knows.  She also took an NSAID about a month ago that was recently continued because of the ulcerations in her mouth.  About two weeks ago, just about the time the stomatitis began she was placed on an antibiotic for suspected upper respiratory infection.  She does not remember the name of the antibiotic.  Although she claims she remembers taking this type of medication in the past without any problems.  She was on that medication three pills a day for three to four days.  She notes no other problems with her skin.  She remembers no allergic reactions to medication.  She has no previous history of fever blisters.  ,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:, Reveals superficial erosions along the lips particularly the lower lips.  The posterior buccal mucosa along the sides of the tongue and also some superficial erosions along the upper and lower gingiva.  Her posterior pharynx was difficult to visualize, but I saw no erosions on the areas today.  There did however appear to be one small erosion on the soft palate.  Examination of the rest of her skin revealed no areas of dermatitis or blistering.  There were some macular hyperpigmentation on the right arm where she has had a previous burn, plus the deformities from her rheumatoid arthritis on her hands and feet as well as scars on her knees from total joint replacement surgeries.  ,IMPRESSION: , Erosive stomatitis probably secondary to methotrexate even though the medication has been used for ten years without any problems.  Methotrexate may produce an erosive stomatitis and enteritis after such a use. The patient also may have an enteritis that at this point may have become more quiescent as she notes that she did have some diarrhea about the time her mouth problem developed. She has had no diarrhea today, however. She has noted no blood in her stools and has had no episodes of nausea or vomiting.  ,I am not as familiar with the NSAID causing an erosive stomatitis.  I understand that it can cause gastrointestinal upset, but given the choice between the two, I would think the methotrexate is the most likely etiology for the stomatitis.  ,RECOMMENDED THERAPY: ,I agree with your therapeutic regimen regarding this condition with the use of prednisone and folic acid.  I also agree that the methotrexate must be discontinued in order to produce a resolution of this patients’ skin problem. However, in my experience, this stomatitis may take a number of weeks to go away completely if a patient been on methotrexate, for an extended period of time, because the medication is stored within the liver and in fatty tissue.  Topically I have prescribed Lidex gel, which I find works extremely well in stomatitis conditions.  It can be applied t.i.d.  ,Thank you very much for allowing me to share in the care of this pleasant patient.  I will follow her with you as needed."
201, Recurrent anterior dislocating left shoulder.  Arthroscopic debridement of the left shoulder with attempted arthroscopic Bankart repair followed by open Bankart arthroplasty of the left shoulder., Arthroscopic Debridement - Shoulder ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Recurrent anterior dislocating left shoulder.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Recurrent anterior dislocating left shoulder.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,  Arthroscopic debridement of the left shoulder with attempted arthroscopic Bankart repair followed by open Bankart arthroplasty of the left shoulder.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to OR #2, administered general anesthetic after ineffective interscalene block had been administered in the preop area.  The patient was positioned in the modified beachchair position utilizing the Mayfield headrest.  The left shoulder was propped posteriorly with a rolled towel.  His head was secured to the Mayfield headrest.  The left shoulder and upper extremity were then prepped and draped in the usual manner.  A posterior lateral port was made for _____ the arthroscopic cannula.  The scope was introduced into the glenohumeral joint.  There was noted to be a complete tear of the anterior glenoid labrum off from superiorly at about 11:30 extending down inferiorly to about 6 o'clock.  The labrum was adherent to the underlying capsule.  The margin of the glenoid was frayed in this area.  The biceps tendon was noted to be intact.  The articular surface of the glenoid was fairly well preserved.  The articular surface on the humeral head was intact; however, there was a large Hill-Sachs lesion on the posterolateral aspect of the humeral head.  The rotator cuff was visualized and noted to be intact.  The axillary pouch was visualized and it was free of injury.  There were some cartilaginous fragments within the axillary pouch.  Attention was first directed after making an anterior portal to fixation of the anterior glenoid labrum.  Utilizing the Chirotech system through the anterior cannula, the labrum was secured with the pin and drill component and was then tacked back to the superior glenoid rim at about the 11 o'clock position.  A second tack was then placed at about the 8 o'clock position.  The labrum was then probed and was noted to be stable.  With some general ranging of the shoulder, the tissue was pulled out from the tacks.  An attempt was made at placement of two other tacks; however, the tissue was not of good quality to be held in position.  Therefore, all tacks were either buried down to a flat surface or were removed from the anterior glenoid area.  At this point, it was deemed that an open Bankart arthroplasty was necessary.  The arthroscopic instruments were removed.  An anterior incision was made extending from just lateral of the coracoid down toward the axillary fold.  The skin incision was taken down through the skin.  Subcutaneous tissues were then separated with the coag Bovie to provide hemostasis.  The deltopectoral fascia was identified.  It was split at the deltopectoral interval and the deltoid was reflected laterally.  The subdeltoid bursa was then removed with rongeurs.  The conjoint tendon was identified.  The deltoid and conjoint tendons were then retracted with a self-retaining retractor.  The subscapularis tendon was identified.  It was separated about a centimeter from its insertion, leaving the tissue to do sew later.  The subscapularis was reflected off superiorly and inferiorly and the muscle retracted medially.  This allowed for visualization of the capsule.  The capsule was split near the humeral head insertion leaving a tag for repair.  It was then split longitudinally towards the glenoid at approximately 9 o'clock position.  This provided visualization of the glenohumeral joint.  The friable labral and capsular tissue was identified.  The glenoid neck was already prepared for suturing, therefore, three Mitek suture anchors were then positioned to place at approximately 7 o'clock, 9 o'clock, and 10 o'clock.  The sutures were passed through the labral capsular tissue and tied securely.  At this point, the anterior glenoid rim had been recreated.  The joint was then copiously irrigated with gentamicin solution and suctioned dry.  The capsule was then repaired with interrupted #1 Vicryl suture and repaired back to its insertion site with #1 Vicryl suture.  This later was then copiously irrigated with gentamicin solution and suctioned dry.  Subscapularis was reapproximated on to the lesser tuberosity of the humerus utilizing interrupted #1 Vicryl suture.  This later was then copiously irrigated as well and suctioned dry.  The deltoid fascia was approximated with running #2-0 Vicryl suture.  Subcutaneous tissues were approximated with interrupted #2-0 Vicryl and the skin was approximated with a running #4-0 subcuticular Vicryl followed by placement of Steri-Strips.  0.25% Marcaine was placed in the subcutaneous area for postoperative analgesia.  The patient was then placed in a shoulder immobilizer after a bulky dressing had been applied.  The patient was then transferred to the recovery room in apparent satisfactory condition."

Preoperative imaging studies revealed the above-noted abnormalities. After a detailed review of management considerations with the patient and his wife, he was elected to proceed as noted above.,Operative indications, methods, potential benefits, risks and alternatives were reviewed. The patient and his wife expressed understanding and consented to proceed as above.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS:, L4-L5 and L5-S1 disk protrusion with configuration as anticipated from preoperative imaging studies. Pedicle screw placement appeared satisfactory with satisfactory purchase and positioning noted at all sites as well as satisfactory findings upon probing of the pedicular tracts at each site. In addition, all pedicle screws were stimulated with findings of above threshold noted at all sites. Spacer snugness and positioning appeared satisfactory. Electrophysiological monitoring was carried out throughout the procedure and remained stable with no undue changes reported.,DESCRIPTION OF THE OPERATION:, After obtaining proper patient identification and appropriate preoperative informed consent, the patient was taken to the operating room on a hospital stretcher in the supine position. After the induction of satisfactory general endotracheal anesthesia and placement of appropriate monitoring equipment by Anesthesiology as well as placement of electrophysiological monitoring equipment by the Neurology team, the patient was carefully turned to the prone position and placed upon the padded Jackson table with appropriate additional padding placed as needed. The patient's posterior lumbosacral region was thoroughly cleansed and shaved. The patient was then scrubbed, prepped and draped in the usual manner. After local infiltration with 1% lidocaine with 1: 200,000 epinephrine solution, a posterior midline skin incision was made extending from approximately L3 to the inferior aspect of the sacrum. Dissection was continued in the midline to the level of the posterior fascia. Self-retaining retractors were placed and subsequently readjusted as needed. The fascia was opened in the midline, and the standard subperiosteal dissection was then carried out to expose the posterior and posterolateral elements from L3-L4 to the sacrum bilaterally with lateral exposure carried out to the lateral aspect of the transverse processes of L4 and L5 as well as the sacral alae bilaterally. _____ by completing the exposure, pedicle screw fixation was carried out in the following manner. Screws were placed in systematic caudal in a cranial fashion. The pedicle screw entry sites were chosen using standard dorsal landmarks and fluoroscopic guidance as needed. Cortical openings were created at these sites using a small burr. The pedicular tracts were then preliminarily prepared using a Lenke pedicle finder. They were then probed and subsequently tapped employing fluoroscopic guidance as needed. Each site was ""under tapped"" and reprobed with satisfactory findings noted as above. Screws in the following dimensions were placed. 6.5-mm diameter screws were placed at all sites. At S1, 40-mm length screws were placed bilaterally. At L5, 40-mm length screws were placed bilaterally, and at L4, 40-mm length screws were placed bilaterally with findings as noted above. The rod was then contoured to span from the L4 to the S1 screws on the right. The distraction was placed across the L4-L5 interspace, and the connections were temporarily secured. Using a matchstick burr, a trough was then carefully created slightly off the midline of the left lamina extending from its caudal aspect to its more cranial aspect at the foraminal level. This was longitudinally oriented. A transverse trough was similarly carefully created from the cranial point of the longitudinal trough out to the lateral aspect of the pars against the foraminal level that is slightly caudal to the L4 pedicle. This trough was completed to the level of the ligamentum flavum using small angled curettes and Kerrison rongeurs, and this portion of the lamina along with the inferior L4 articular process was then removed as a unit using rongeurs and curettes. The cranial aspect of the left L5 superior articular process was then removed using a small burr and angled curettes and Kerrison rongeurs. A superior laminotomy was performed from the left L5 lamina and flavectomy was then carried out across this region of decompression, working from caudally to cranially and medially to laterally, again using curettes and Kerrison rongeurs under direct visualization. In this manner, the left lateral aspect of the thecal sac passing left L5 spinal nerve and exiting left L4 spinal nerve along with posterolateral aspect of disk space was exposed. Local epidural veins were coagulated with bipolar and divided. Gelfoam was then placed in this area. This process was then repeated in similar fashion; thereby, exposing the posterolateral aspect of the left L5-S1 disk space. As noted, distraction had previously been placed at L4-L5, this was released. Distraction was placed across the L5-S1 interspace. After completing satisfactory exposure as noted, a annulotomy was made in the posterolateral left aspect of the L5-S1 disk space. Intermittent neural retraction was employed with due caution afforded to the neural elements throughout the procedure. The disk space was entered, and diskectomy was carried out in routine fashion using pituitary rongeurs followed by the incremental sized disk space shavers as well as straight and then angled TLIF curettes to prepare the front plate. Herniated portions of the disk were also removed in routine fashion. The diskectomy and endplate preparation were carried out working progressively from the left towards the right aspect of the disk across the midline in routine fashion. After completing this disk space preparation, Gelfoam was again placed. The decompression was assessed and appeared to be satisfactory. The distraction was released, and attention was redirected at L4-L5, where again, distraction was placed and diskectomy and endplate preparation was carried out at this interspace again in similar fashion. After completing the disk space preparation, attention was redirected to L5-S1. Distraction was released at L4-L5 and again, reapplied at L5-S1, incrementally increasing size. Trial spaces were used, and a 10-mm height by 26-mm length spacer was chosen. A medium BMP kit was appropriately reconstituted. A BMP sponge containing morcellated vertebral autograft was then placed into the anterior aspect of the disk space. The spacer was then carefully impacted into position. The distraction was released. The spacer was checked with satisfactory snugness and positioning noted. This process was then repeated in similar fashion at L4-L5, again with placement of a 10-mm height by 26-mm length Capstone spacer, again containing BMP and again with initial placement of a BMP sponge with vertebral autograft anteriorly within the interspace. This spacer was also checked again with satisfactory snugness and positioning noted. The prior placement of the spacers and BMP, the wound was thoroughly irrigated and dried with satisfactory hemostasis noted. Surgicel was placed over the exposed dura and disk space. The distraction was released on the right and compression plates across the L5-S1 and L4-L5 interspaces and the connections fully tightened in routine fashion. The posterolateral elements on the right from L4 to S1 were prepared for fusion in routine fashion, and BMP sponges with supplemental vertebral autograft was placed in the posterolateral fusion bed as well as the vertebral autograft in the dorsal aspect of the L4-L5 and L5-S1 facets on the right in a routine fashion. A left-sided rod was appropriated contoured and placed to span between the L4 to S1 screws. Again compression was placed across the L4-L5 and L5-S1 segments, and these connections were fully secured. Thorough hemostasis was ascertained after checking the construct closely and fluoroscopically. The wound was closed using multiple simple interrupted 0-Vicryl sutures to reapproximate the deep paraspinal musculature in the midline. The superficial paraspinal musculature in posterior fashion was closed in the midline using multiple simple interrupted 0-Vicryl sutures. The suprafascial subcutaneous layers were closed using multiple simple interrupted #0 and 2-0 Vicryl sutures. The skin was then closed using staples. Sterile dressings were then applied and secured in place. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was to the recovery room in satisfactory condition."

After adequate sedation was achieved by the anesthesia team, the above-mentioned anesthetic mixture was infiltrated directly into the patient's left foot to anesthetize the future surgical sites.  The left ankle was covered with cast padding and an 18-inch ankle tourniquet was placed around the left ankle and set at 250 mmHg.  The left foot was then prepped, scrubbed, and draped in normal sterile technique.  The left ankle tourniquet was inflated.  Attention was then directed on the dorsomedial aspect of the first left metatarsophalangeal joint where a 6-cm linear incision was placed directly over the first left metatarsophalangeal joint parallel and medial to the course of the extensor hallucis longus tendon to the left great toe.  The incision was deepened through subcutaneous tissues.  All the bleeders were identified, cut, clamped, and cauterized.  The incision was deepened to the level of the capsule and the periosteum of the first left metatarsophalangeal joint.  All the tendinous neurovascular structures were identified and retracted from the site to be preserved.  Using sharp and dull dissection, the periosteal and capsular attachments were mobilized from the head of the first left metatarsal.  The conjoint tendon was identified on the lateral plantar aspect of the base of the proximal phalanx of the left great toe and transversally resected from its insertion.  A lateral capsulotomy was also performed at the level of the first left metatarsophalangeal joint.  The dorsomedial prominence of the first left metatarsal head was adequately exposed using sharp dissection and resected with the use of a sagittal saw.  The same saw was used to perform an Austin-type bunionectomy on the capital aspect of the first left metatarsal head with its apex distal and its base proximal on the shaft of the first left metatarsal.  The dorsal arm of the osteotomy was longer than the plantar arm in order to accommodate for the future internal fixation.  The capital fragment of the first left metatarsal was then transposed laterally and impacted on the shaft of the first left metatarsal.  Provisional fixation was achieved with two smooth wires that were inserted vertically to the dorsal osteotomy in a dorsal distal to plantar proximal direction.  The same wires were also used as guide wires for the insertion of a 16-mm and an 18-mm partially threaded screws from the 3.0 OsteoMed System upon insertion of the screws, which was accomplished using AO technique.  The wires were removed.  Fixation on the table was found to be excellent.  Reduction of the bunion deformity was also found to be excellent and position of the first left metatarsophalangeal joint was anatomical.  The remaining bony prominence from the shaft of the first left metatarsal was then resected with a sagittal saw.  The area was copiously flushed with saline.  The periosteal and capsular tissues were approximated with 2-0 and 3-0 Vicryl suture material, 4-0 Vicryl was used to approximate the subcutaneous tissues.  The incision site was reinforced with Steri-Strips.  At this time, the patient's left ankle tourniquet was deflated.  The time was 45 minutes.  Immediate hyperemia was noted to the entire right lower extremity upon deflation of the cuff.  The patient's incision was covered with Xeroform, copious amounts of fluff and Kling, stockinette, and an Ace bandage.  The patient's left foot was then placed in a surgical shoe.  The patient was then transferred to the recovered room under the care of the anesthesia team with her vital signs stable and her vascular status at appropriate levels.  The patient was given pain medication and instructions on how to control her postoperative course.  The patient was discharged from Hospital according to nursing protocol and was advised to follow up with Dr. X in one week's time for her first postoperative appointment."

She subsequently actually done reasonably well until about a month ago when she developed progressive severe intractable pain.  Imaging study showed that the distal hardware at the plate itself had fractured consistent with incomplete fusion across her osteomyelitis area.  There was no evidence of infection on the imaging or with her laboratory studies.  In addition, she developed a pretty profound stenosis at L4-L5 and L5-S1 that appeared to be recurrent as well.  She now presents for revision of her hardware, extension of fusion, and decompression.,The patient was brought to the operating room, placed under satisfactory general endotracheal anesthesia.  She was placed on the operative table in the prone position.  Back was prepared with Betadine, iodine, and alcohol.  We elliptically excised her old incision and extended this caudally so that we had access from the existing hardware fixation all the way down to her sacrum.  The locking nuts were removed from the screw post and both plates refractured or significantly weakened and had a crease in it.  After these were removed, it was obvious that the bottom screws were somewhat loosened in the pedicle zone so we actually tightened one up and that fit good snugly into the nail when we redirected so that it actually reamed up into the upper aspect of the vertebral body in much more secure purchase.  We then dressed the L4-L5 and L5-S1 levels which were profoundly stenotic.  This was a combination of scar and overgrown bone.  She had previously undergone bilateral hemilaminectomies at L4-5 so we removed scar bone and actually cleaned and significantly decompressed the dura at both of these levels.  After completing this, we inserted the Capstone interbody spacer filled with morselized autograft bone and some BMP sponge into the disk space at both levels.  We used 10 x 32 mm spacers at both L4-L5 and L5-S1.  This corrected the deformity and helped to preserve the correction of the stenosis and then after we cannulated the pedicles of L4, L5 and S1 tightened the pedicle screws in L3.  This allowed us to actually seat a 20 cm plate contoured to the lumbar lordosis onto the pedicle screws all the way from S1 up to the T11 level.  Once we placed the plate onto the screws and locked them in position, we then packed the remaining BMP sponge and morselized autograft bone through the plate around the incomplete fracture healing at the L1 level and then dorsolaterally at L4-L5 and L5-S1 and L3-L4, again the goal being to create a dorsal fusion and enhance the interbody fusion as well.  The wound was then irrigated copiously with bacitracin solution and then we closed in layers using #1 Vicryl in muscle and fascia, 3-0 in subcutaneous tissue and approximated staples in the skin.  Prior to closing the skin, we confirmed correct sponge and needle count.  We placed a drain in the extrafascial space and then confirmed that there were no other foreign bodies.  The Cell Saver blood was recycled and she was given two units of packed red blood cells as well.  I was present for and performed the entire procedure myself or supervised."

Transconjunctival exploration of right orbital floor with release of entrapped periorbita.,3.  Open reduction of nasal septum and nasal pyramid fracture with osteotomy.,ANESTHESIA:,  General endotracheal anesthesia.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was placed in the supine position.  Under affects of general endotracheal anesthesia, head and neck were prepped and draped with pHisoHex solution and draped in the appropriate sterile fashion.  A gull-wing incision was drawn over the forehead scalp.  Hair was removed along the suture line and incision was made to skin and subcutaneous tissue of the scalp down to, but not including the pericranium.  An inferiorly based forehead flap was then elevated to the superior orbital rim.  The depression of the anterior table of the frontal sinus was noted.  An incision was made more posterior creating an inferiorly based pericranial flap.  The supraorbital nerve was axing from the supraorbital foramen and the supraorbital foramen was converted to a groove in order to allow further inferior displacement and positioning of the forehead flap.  These allowed exposure of the medial orbital wall on the right side.  The displaced fractures of the right medial orbital wall were repositioned through coronal approach.  ,Further reduction of the nose intranasally also allowed the ethmoid fracture to be aligned more appropriately in the medial wall.  The anterior table fracture was satisfactorily reduced.  Multiple 1.3-mm screws and plate fixation were utilized to recontour the anterior forehead.  A mucocele was removed from the frontal sinus and there was no significant destruction of the posterior wall.  A sinus seeker was utilized and passed into the nasofrontal duct without difficulty.  It was felt that the frontal sinus obliteration would not be necessary.,At this point, the pericranial flap was folded in a fan-folded fashion on top of the plate and screw and hardware and fixed in position with the sutures to remain better contour of the forehead.  At this point, the nose was significantly shifted to the left and an open reduction of the nasal fracture was performed by osteotomies, which were made medially, laterally, and percutaneous transverse osteotomy of the nasal bone on the right side.  There is significant depression of the nasal bone on the left side.  A medial osteotomy was performed on the left side mobilizing nasal pyramid satisfactorily.  There is a high septal deviation, which would not allow complete correction of the deviation.  It was felt that this would best be left for a later date.  Open reduction rhinoplasty could be performed with spread of cartilage grafting in order to straighten the septum high dorsally.  Local infiltration anesthesia 1% Xylocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine was infiltrated in the conjunctival fornix of the right lower eyelid as well as the inferior orbital rim.  An incision was made in the palpebral conjunctiva and capsular palpebral fascia beneath the tarsal plate preseptal approach to the inferior orbital rim was performed in this fashion.  Dissection proceeded down to the inferior orbital rim and subperiosteal dissection was performed over the orbital floor.  Hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery.  There was entrapped periorbita, which was released to the fractures, which were repositioned, but not fixed in position.  The forced ductions were performed, which demonstrated release of the periorbit satisfactorily.  The conjunctival incision was closed with an interrupted simple 6-0 plain gut suture.  The nasal pyramid was satisfactorily mobilized as well as the nasal septum and brought back to midline position with the help of a Boies elevator for the septum.  The coronal incision was closed with interrupted 3-0 PDS suture for the galea and deep subcutaneous tissue and the skin closed with interrupted surgical staples.  Nose was dressed with Steri-Strips.  Mastisol Orthoplast splint was prepared after the Doyle splints were placed in the nose and secured with 3-0 Prolene suture and the nose packed with two Kennedy Merocel sponges.  A supportive mildly compressive dressing with fluffs, Kerlix, and 4-inch Ace were applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was returned to recovery room in satisfactory condition."

This was found to be moderately corrected.  Hardware was found to be in good positions on AP and lateral projections using fluoroscopy.,INDICATIONS: , The patient has a history of severe neurogenic scoliosis.  He was indicated for anterior and posterior spinal fusion to allow for correction of the curvature as well as prevention of further progression.  Risks and benefits were discussed at length with the family over many visits.  They wished to proceed.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table in the supine position.  General anesthesia was induced without incident.  He was given a weight-adjusted dose of antibiotics.  Appropriate lines were then placed.  He had a neuromonitoring performed as well.,He was then initially placed in the lateral decubitus position with his left side down and right side up.  An oblique incision was then made over the flank overlying the 10th rib.  Underlying soft tissues were incised down at the skin incision.  The rib was then identified and subperiosteal dissection was performed.  The rib was then removed and used for autograft placement later.,The underlying pleura was then split longitudinally.  This allowed for entry into the pleural space.  The lung was then packed superiorly with wet lap.  The diaphragm was then identified and this was split to allow for access to the thoracolumbar spine.,Once the spine was achieved, subperiosteal dissection was performed over the visualized vertebral bodies.  This required cauterization of the segmental vessels.  Once the subperiosteal dissection was performed to the posterior and anterior extents possible, the diskectomies were performed.  These were performed from T11-L3.  This was over 5 levels.  Disks and endplates were then removed.  Once this was performed, morcellized rib autograft was placed into the spaces.  The table had been previously bent to allow for easier access of the spine.  This was then straightened to allow for compression and some correction of the curvature.,The diaphragm was then repaired as was the pleura overlying the thoracic cavity.  The ribs were held together with #1 Vicryl sutures.  Muscle layers were then repaired using a running #2-0 PDS sutures and the skin was closed using running inverted #2-0 PDS suture as well.  Skin was closed as needed with running #4-0 Monocryl.  This was dressed with Xeroform dry sterile dressings and tape.,The patient was then rotated into a prone position.  The spine was prepped and draped in a standard fashion.,Longitudinal incision was made from T2-L5.  The underlying soft tissues were incised down at the skin incision.  Electrocautery was then used to maintain hemostasis.  The spinous processes were then identified and the overlying apophyses were split.  This allowed for subperiosteal dissection over the spinous processes, lamina, facet joints, and transverse processes.  Once this was completed, the C-arm was brought in, which allowed for easy placement of screws in the lumbar spine.  These were placed at L4 and L5.  The interspaces between the spinous processes were then cleared of soft tissue and ligamentum flavum.  This was done using a rongeur as well as a Kerrison rongeur.  Spinous processes were then harvested for morcellized autograft.,Once all the interspaces were prepared, Songer wires were then passed.  These were placed from L3-T3.,Once the wires were placed, a unit rod was then positioned.  This was secured initially at the screws distally on both the left and right side.  The wires were then tightened in sequence from the superior extent to the inferior extent, first on the left-sided spine where I was operating and then on the right side spine.  This allowed for excellent correction of the scoliotic curvature.,Decortication was then performed and placement of a morcellized autograft and allograft was then performed after thoroughly irrigating the wound with 4 liters of normal saline mixed with bacitracin.  This was done using pulsed lavage.,The wound was then closed in layers.  The deep fascia was closed using running #1 PDS suture, subcutaneous tissue was closed using running inverted #2-0 PDS suture, the skin was closed using #4-0 Monocryl as needed.  The wound was then dressed with Steri-Strips, Xeroform dry sterile dressings, and tape.  The patient was awakened from anesthesia and taken to the intensive care unit in stable condition.  All instrument, sponge, and needle counts were correct at the end of the case.,The patient will be managed in the ICU and then on the floor as indicated."

Gauze throat pack was placed and the right buccal vestibule was palpated and area of the abscess was located.  The abscess cavity was aspirated using a 5 mL syringe with an 18-gauge needle.  Approximately 1 mL of purulent material was aspirated that was placed on aerobic and anaerobic cultures.  Culture swabs and the tooth sent to the laboratory for culture and sensitivity testing.,The area in the buccal vestibule was then opened with approximately 1-cm incision.  Blunt dissection was then used to open up the abscess cavity and explore the abscess cavity.  A small amount of additional purulence was drained from it, approximately 1 mL and at this point, tooth #T was extracted by forceps extraction.  Periosteal elevator was used to explore the area near the extraction site.  This was continuous with abscess cavity, so the abscess cavity was allowed to drain into the extraction site.  No drain was placed.  Upon completion of the procedure, the throat pack was removed.  The pharynx was suctioned.  The stomach was also suctioned and the patient was then awakened, extubated, and taken to the recovery room in stable condition."

The patient states that the mass has been present for approximately two weeks and has been rapidly growing in size.  The patient also has history of shave biopsy in the past.  The patient does state that he desires surgical excision at this time.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  An IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area.  The patient was transported from the operating room and placed on the operating room table in the supine position with the safety belt across his lap.  Copious amount of Webril was placed around the left ankle followed by a blood pressure cuff.  After adequate sedation by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 6 cc mixed with 1% lidocaine plain with 0.5% Marcaine plain was injected in a digital block fashion at the base of the left hallux as well as the left second toe.,The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion.  The foot was elevated from the operating table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage.  Care was taken with the exsanguination to perform exsanguination below the level of the digits so as not to rupture the masses.  The foot was lowered to the operating table.  The stockinet was reflected and the foot was cleansed with wet and dry sponge.  A distal Syme's incision was planned over the distal aspect of the left hallux.  The incision was performed with a #10 blade and deepened with #15 down to the level of bone.  The dorsal skin flap was removed and dissected in toto off of the distal phalanx.  There was noted to be in growth of the soft tissue mass into the dorsal cortex with erosion in the dorsal cortex and exposure of cortical bone at the distal phalanx.  The tissue was sent to Pathology where Dr. Green stated that a frozen sample would be of less use for examining for cancer.  Dr. Green did state that he felt that there was an adequate incomplete excision of the soft tissue for specimen.  At this time, a sagittal saw was then used to resect all ends of bone of the distal phalanx.  The area was inspected for any remaining suspicious tissues.  Any suspicious tissue was removed.  The area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  The skin was then reapproximated with #4-0 nylon with a combination of simple and vertical mattress sutures.,Attention was then directed to the left second toe.  There was noted to be a dorsolateral mass over the dorsal distal aspect of the left second toe.  A linear incision was made just medial to the tissue mass.  The mass was then dissected from the overlying skin and off of the underlying capsule.  This tissue mass was hard, round, and pearly-gray in appearance.  It does not invade into any other surrounding tissues.  The area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline and the skin was closed with #4-0 nylon.  Dressings consisted of Owen silk soaked in Betadine, 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix, and an Ace wrap.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to all five digits of the left foot.  The patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well without complications.  The patient was transported to PACU with vital signs stable and vascular status intact.  The patient was given postoperative pain prescription for Vicodin and instructed to follow up with Dr. Bonnani in his office as directed.  The patient will be contacted immediately pending the results of pathology.  Cultures obtained in the case were aerobic and anaerobic gram stain, Silver stain, and a CBC."

The patient received topical lidocaine by nebulization.  The flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope was introduced orally.  The patient had normal teeth, normal tongue, normal jaw, and her vocal cords moved symmetrically and were without lesions.  I proceeded to the right upper lobe where a mucous plug was noted in the subsegmental bronchus of the posterior segment of the right upper lobe.  I proceeded under fluoroscopic guidance to guide the biopsy wire in this area and took four biopsies.  Followup fluoroscopy was negative for pneumothorax.  I wedged the bronchoscope in the subsegmental bronchus and achieved good hemostasis after three minutes.,I then proceeded to inspect the rest of the tracheobronchial tree, which was without lesions.  I performed a bronchial washing after the biopsies in the right upper lobe.  I then performed two transbronchial needle aspirations with a Wang needle biopsy in the precarinal area.  All of these samples were sent for histology and cytology respectively.  Estimated blood loss was approximately 5 cc.  Good hemostasis was achieved.

A time-out process had been followed and preoperative antibiotics were given.,The patient was positioned with the left side up for a left thoracotomy.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  A posterolateral thoracotomy was performed.  It included the previous incision.  The chest was entered through the fifth intercostal space.  Actually, there was a very strong and hard parietal pleura, which initially did not allow us to obtain a good exposure, and actually the layer was so tough that the pin of the chest retractor broke.  Thanks to Dr. X's ingenuity, we were able to reuse the chest retractor and opened the chest after I incised the thickened parietal pleura resulting in an explosion of gas and pus from a cavity that was obviously welled off by the parietal pleura.  We aspirated an abundant amount of pus from this cavity.  The sample was taken for culture and sensitivity.,Then, at least half an hour was spent trying to excise the parietal pleura and finally we were able to accomplish that up to the apex and back to the aorta __________ towards the heart including his diaphragm.  Once we accomplished that, we proceeded to remove the solid exudate that was adhered to the lung.  Further samples for culture and sensitivity were sent.,Then, we were left with the trapped lung.  It was trapped by thickened visceral pleura.  This was the most difficult part of the operation and it was very difficult to remove the parietal pleura without injuring the lung extensively.  Finally, we were able to achieve this and after the corresponding lumen of the endotracheal tube was opened, we were able to inflate both the left upper and lower lobes of the lung satisfactorily.  There was only one area towards the mediastinum that apparently I was not able to fill.  This area, of course, was very rigid but any surgery in the direction __________ would have caused __________ injury, so I restrained from doing that.  Two large chest tubes were placed.  The cavity had been abundantly irrigated with warm saline.  Then, the thoracotomy was closed in layers using heavy stitches of Vicryl as pericostal sutures and then several figure-of-eight interrupted sutures to the muscle layers and a combination of nylon stitches and staples to the skin.,The chest tubes were affixed to the skin with heavy sutures of silk.  Dressings were applied and the patient was put back in the supine position and after a few minutes of observation and evaluation, he was able to be extubated in the operating room.,Estimated blood loss was about 500 mL.  The patient tolerated the procedure very well and was sent to the ICU in a satisfactory condition."

", Pain from Hernia - ER Consult ,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  ,This is a 53-year-old man, who presented to emergency room with multiple complaints including pain from his hernia, some question of blood in his stool, nausea, and vomiting, and also left lower extremity pain.  At the time of my exam, he states that his left lower extremity pain has improved considerably.  He apparently had more significant paresthesias in the past and now he feels that the paresthesias have improved considerably.  He does have a history of multiple medical problems including atrial fibrillation, he is on Coumadin, which is currently subtherapeutic, multiple CVAs in the past, peripheral vascular disease, and congestive heart failure.  He has multiple chronic history of previous ischemia of his large bowel in the past.,PHYSICAL EXAM,VITAL SIGNS:  Currently his temperature is 98.2, pulse is 95, and blood pressure is 138/98.,HEENT:  Unremarkable.,LUNGS:  Clear.,CARDIOVASCULAR:  An irregular rhythm.,ABDOMEN:  Soft.,EXTREMITIES:  His upper extremities are well perfused.  He has palpable radial and femoral pulses.  He does not have any palpable pedal pulses in either right or left lower extremity.  He does have reasonable capillary refill in both feet.  He has about one second capillary refill on both the right hand and left lower extremities and his left foot is perhaps little cool, but it is relatively warm.  Apparently, this was lot worst few hours ago.  He describes significant pain and pallor, which he feels has improved and certainly clinically at this point does not appear to be as significant.,IMPRESSION AND PLAN: , This gentleman with a history of multiple comorbidities as detailed above had what sounds clinically like acute exacerbation of chronic peripheral vascular disease, essentially related to spasm versus a small clot, which may have been lysed to some extent.  He currently has a viable extremity and viable foot, but certainly has significant making compromised flow.  It is unclear to me whether this is chronic or acute, and whether he is a candidate for any type of intervention.  He certainly would benefit from an angiogram to better to define his anatomy and anticoagulation in the meantime.  Given his potential history of recent lower GI bleeding, he has been evaluated by GI to see whether or not he is a candidate for heparinization.  We will order an angiogram for the next few hours and followup on those results to better define his anatomy and to determine whether or not if any interventions are appropriate.  Again, at this point, he has no pain, relatively rapid capillary refill, and relatively normal motor function suggesting a viable extremity.  We will follow him along closely."

Then the anterior aspect of the neck was prepped and draped in a routine sterile fashion.  A linear skin incision was made in the skin fold line from just to the right of the midline to the leading edge of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle and taken sharply to platysma, which was dissected only in a subplatysmal manner bluntly, and with only blunt dissection at the prevertebral space where a localizing intraoperative x-ray was obtained, once self-retaining retractors were placed along the mesial edge of a cauterized longus colli muscle, to protect surrounding tissues throughout the remainder of the case.  A prominent anterior osteophyte at C5-C6 was then localized, compared to preoperative studies in the usual fashion intraoperatively, and the osteophyte was excised with a rongeur and bony fragments saved.  This allowed for an annulotomy, which was carried out with a #11 blade and discectomy, removed with straight disc forceps portions of the disc, which were sent to Pathology for a permanent section.  Residual osteophytes and disc fragments were removed with 1 and 2-mm micro Kerrison rongeurs as necessary as drilling extended into normal cortical and cancellous elements widely laterally as well.  A hypertrophied ligament and prominent posterior spurs were excised as well until the dura bulged into the interspace, a sign of a decompressed status.  At no time during the case was evidence of CSF leakage, and hemostasis was readily achieved with pledgets of Gelfoam subsequently removed with copious amounts of antibiotic irrigation.  Once the decompression was inspected with a double ball dissector and all found to be completely decompressed, and the dura bulged at the interspace, and pulsated, then a Bengal cage was filled with the patient's own bone elements and fusion putty and countersunk into position, and was quite tightly applied.  Further stability was added nonetheless with an appropriate size Uniplate, which was placed of appropriate size with appropriate size screws and these were locked into place in the usual manner.  The wound was inspected, and irrigated again with antibiotic solution and after further inspection was finally closed in a routine closure in a multiple layer event by first approximation of the platysma with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl, and the skin with a subcuticular stitch of 4-0 Vicryl, and this was Steri-Stripped for reinforcement, and a sterile dressing was applied, incorporating a Penrose drain, which was carried from the prevertebral space externally to the skin wound and safety pin for security in the usual manner.  Once the sterile dressing was applied, the patient was taken from the operating room to the recovery area having left in stable condition.,At the conclusion of the case, all instruments, needle, and sponge counts were accurate and correct, and there were no intraoperative complications of any type."
219, Patient referred for evaluation of tracheostomy tube placement and treatment recommendations., Tracheostomy Tube Consult ,"HISTORY:  ,I had the pleasure of meeting and evaluating the patient today, referred for evaluation of tracheostomy tube placement and treatment recommendations.  As you are well aware, he is a pleasant 64-year-old gentleman who unfortunately is suffering from end-stage COPD, who required tracheostomy tube placement about three months ago when being treated for acute exacerbation of COPD and having difficulty coming off ventilatory support.  He now resides in an extended care facility with a capped tracheostomy tube, and he unfortunately states he has had not had to use the tracheostomy tube since his discharge and admission to the extended care facility.  He requires constant oxygen administration and has been having no problems with shortness of breath, worsening, requiring opening the tracheostomy tube site.  He states there has been some tenderness associated with the tracheostomy tube and difficulty with swallowing and he wishes to have it removed.  Apparently there is no history of any airway issues while sleeping or need for uncapping the tube and essentially the tube has just remained present for months capped in his neck.  No history of any previous tracheostomy tube insertion.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , COPD, history of hypercarbic hypoxemia, history of coronary artery disease, history of previous myocardial infarction, and history of liver cirrhosis secondary to alcohol use.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  ,Tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy, cholecystectomy, appendectomy, hernia repair, and tracheostomy.,FAMILY HISTORY:  ,Strong for heart disease, coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cerebrovascular accident.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,  Prevacid, folic acid, aspirin, morphine sulfate, Pulmicort, Risperdal, Colace, clonazepam, Lotrisone, Roxanol, Ambien, Zolpidem tartrate, simethicone, Robitussin, and prednisone.,ALLERGIES: , Nitroglycerin.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , The patient has a 25-year-smoking history, which I believe is quite heavy and he has a significant alcohol use in the past.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  ,VITAL SIGNS:  Age 64, blood pressure is 110/78, pulse 96, and temperature is 98.6.,GENERAL:  The patient was examined in his wheelchair, resting comfortably, in no acute distress.,HEAD:  Normocephalic.  No masses or lesions noted.,FACE:  No facial tenderness or asymmetry noted.,EYES:  Pupils are equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation bilaterally.  Extraocular movements are intact bilaterally.,EARS:  The tympanic membranes are intact bilaterally with a good light reflex.  The external auditory canals are clear with no lesions or masses noted.  Weber and Rinne tests are within normal limits.,NOSE:  The nasal cavities are patent bilaterally.  The nasal septum is midline.  There are no nasal discharges.  No masses or lesions noted.,THROAT:  The oral mucosa appears healthy.  Dental hygiene is maintained well.  No oropharyngeal masses or lesions noted.  No postnasal drip noted.,NECK:  The patient has a stable-appearing tracheostomy tube site and the stoma appears to be without signs of infection.  The previous incision was vertical in nature and there is no hypertrophic scar formation.  No adenopathy noted.  No stridor noted.,NEUROLOGIC:  Cranial nerve VII intact bilaterally.  No signs of tremor.,LUNGS:  Diminished breath sounds in all four quadrants.

History of coronary artery disease.,4.  History of myocardial infarction.,5.  History of cirrhosis of liver.,RECOMMENDATIONS: , I discussed with the patient in detail after fiberoptic laryngoscopy and limited bronchoscopy was performed in the office whether or not to pull out the tracheostomy tube.  His vocal cords moved well, and I do not see any signs of granuloma or airway obstruction either in the supraglottic or subglottic region, and I felt he would tolerate the tube being removed with close monitoring by nursing at his extended care facility.  I did impress the fact that I believe he probably will have other events requiring airway support, which could include intubation, and if the intubation is prolonged a tracheostomy may be needed.  Creation of a long-term tracheostoma may be beneficial whereas the patient would not need such a long tracheostomy tube, and I informed the patient there are other options other than the tube he has at the present time.  The patient still wished to have the tube removed and he is aware he may need to have it replaced or he may have trouble with the area healing or scarring or he could end up having an emergent airway situation with the tube gone, but wishes to have it removed, and I did remove it today.  Dressing was applied and we will see him back next week to make sure everything is healing properly."

Insertion of tissue expander to the lateral wound.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,TOURNIQUET: , None.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General.,INDICATIONS: , This patient developed a compartment syndrome.  She underwent 4 compartment fasciotomy with dual incision on medial and lateral aspect of the right lower leg.  She was doing very well and was obviously improving.,The swelling was reduced.  A compartment pressure had obviously improved based on examination.  She was therefore indicated for placement of tissue expander for ventral wound closure.  The risks of procedure as well as alternatives of this procedure were discussed at length with the patient and he understood them well.  Risks and benefits were all discussed, risk of bleeding, infection, damage to blood vessels, damage to nerve roots, need for further surgery, chronic pain with range of motion, risk of continued discomfort, risk of need for further reconstructive procedures, risk of blood clots, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and risk of death were discussed.  She understood them well.  All questions were answered, and she signed the consent for the procedure as described.,DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE:,  The patient was placed on the operating table and general anesthesia was achieved.  The medial wound was noted to be approximately 10.5 cm in length x 4 cm.  The lateral wound was noted in approximately 14 cm in length x 5 x 5 cm in width.  Both wounds were then thoroughly debrided.  The debridement of both wounds included skin and subcutaneous tissue and nonviable muscle portion.  This involve very small portion of muscle as well as skin edge and the subcutaneous tissue did require debridement on both sides.  At this point adequate debridement was performed and healthy tissue did appear to be present.  Initially on the medial wound I did place the DermaClose RC continuous external tissue expander.  On the medial wound the 5 skin anchors were placed on each side of the wound and separated appropriately.  I then did place the line loop from the tension controller in a lace like manner through the skin anchors and the tension controller was attached to the middle anchor.  I then did place adequate tension on the sutures.  Continued tension will be noted after engaging the tension controller.  At this point I performed the similar procedure to the lateral wound.  The skin anchors were placed separately and appropriately on either side of the skin margin.  The line loop from the tension controller was placed in lace like manner through the skin anchors.  The tension controller was then attached to the mid anchor and appropriate tension was applied.,It must be noted I did undermine the skin edges both sides of flap from both incision site prior to placement of the skin anchor and adequate mobilization was obtained.  Adequate tension was placed in this region.  A non thick dressing was then applied to the open-wound region and sterile dressing was then applied.  No complications were encountered throughout the procedure and the patient tolerated the procedure well.  The patient was taken to recovery room in stable condition."

General anesthesia was induced by the anesthesiologist.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A lid speculum was used to provide exposure to the right eye.  A 360-degree limbal conjunctival peritomy was created with Westcott scissors.  Curved tenotomy scissors were used to enter each of the intermuscular quadrants.  The inferior rectus muscle was isolated with a muscle hook, freed of its Tenon's attachment and tied with a 2-0 silk suture.  The 3 other rectus muscles were isolated in a similar fashion.  The 4 scleral quadrants were inspected and found to be free of scleral thinning or staphyloma."

The occipital area was shaven bilaterally and then the areas of the prior scalp incisions were infiltrated with 0.25% Marcaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine after routine prepping and draping.  Both U-shaped scalp incisions were opened exposing both the left and the right ventricular catheters as well as the old low pressure reservoir, which might have been leading to the coaptation of the ventricles.  The patient also had a right subtemporal depression, which was full preoperatively.  The entire old apparatus was dissected out.  We then cut both the ventricular catheters and secured them with sutures so that __________ could be inserted.  They were both inspected.  No definite debris were seen.  After removing the ventricular catheters, the old tracts were inspected and we could see where there was coaptation of the ventricles against the ventricular catheter.  On the right side, we elected to insert the Portnoy ventricular catheter and on the left a new Bactiseal catheter was inserted underneath the corpus callosum in a different location.  The old valve was dissected out and the proGAV valve with a 2-0 shunt assist was inserted and secured with a 2-0 Ethibond suture.  The proGAV valve was then connected to a Bactiseal distal tubing, which was looped in a cephalad way and then curved towards the left burr hole site and then the Portnoy catheter on the right was secured with a right-angled sleeve and then interposed between it and the left burr hole site with a flushing reservoir.  All connections secured with 2-0 Ethibond suture and a small piece of Bactiseal tubing between the flushing reservoir and the connector, which secured the left Bactiseal tubing to the two other Bactiseal tubings one being the distal Bactiseal tubing going towards the proGAV valve, which was set to an opening pressure of 8 and the other one being the Bactiseal tubing, which was going towards the flushing reservoir.,All the wounds were irrigated out with bacitracin and then closed in a routine manner using Vicryl for the deep layers and Monocryl for the skin, followed by Mastisol and Steri-Strips.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without complications.  CSF was not sent off."

Repair of rotator cuff through mini-arthrotomy.,FINDINGS AT OPERATION: , The patient's glenohumeral joint was completely clear, other than obvious tear of the rotator cuff.  The midportion of this appeared to be complete, but for the most part, this was about a 60% rupture of the tendon.  This was confirmed later when the bursal side was opened up.  Note, the patient also had abrasion of the coracoacromial ligament under the anterolateral edge of the acromion.  He did not have any acromioclavicular joint pain or acromioclavicular joint disease noted.,PROCEDURE:,  He was given an anesthetic, examined, prepped, and draped in a sterile fashion in a beach-chair position.  The shoulder was instilled with fluid from posteriorly, followed by the arthroscope.  The shoulder was instilled with fluid from posteriorly, followed by the arthroscope.  Arthroscopy was then carried out in standard fashion using a 30-degree Dionic scope.  With the scope in the posterior portal, the above findings were noted, and an anterior portal was established.  A curved shaver was placed for debridement of the tear.  I established this was about a 60-70% tear with a probable complete area of tear which was very small.  There were no problems at the biceps or the rest of the joint.  The subacromial space showed findings, as noted above, and a thorough subacromial decompression was carried out with a Bovie, rotary shaver, and bur.  I did not debride the acromioclavicular joint.  The lateral portal was then extended to a mini-arthrotomy, and subacromial space was entered by blunt dissection through the deltoid.  The area of weakness of the tendon was found, and was transversely cut, and findings were confirmed.  The diseased tissue was removed, and the greater tuberosity was abraded with a rongeur.  Tendon-to-tendon repair was then carried out with buried sutures of 2-0 Ethibond, giving a very nice repair.  The shoulder was carried through a range of motion.  I could see no evidence of impingement.  Copious irrigation was carried out.  The deltoid deep fascia was anatomically closed, as was the superficial fascia.  The subcutaneous tissue and skin were closed in layers.  A sterile dressing was applied.  The patient appeared to tolerate the procedure well."

At this time, a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was placed on the patient's right ankle for the purpose of maintaining hemostasis.  Number of the anesthesias was obtained and then induced mild sedation and local anesthetic as described above was infiltrated about the surgical site.  The right foot was then scrubbed, prepped, and draped in the usual aseptic manner.  An Esmarch bandage was then used to exsanguinate the patient's right foot, and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet inflated to 200 mmHg.  Attention was then directed to dorsal aspect of the first metatarsophalangeal joint where a linear longitudinal incision measuring approximately a 3.5 cm in length was made.  The incision was carried deep utilizing both sharp and blunt dissections.  All major neurovascular structures were avoided.  At this time, through the original skin incision, attention was directed to the first intermetatarsal space where utilizing both sharp and blunt dissection the deep transverse intermetatarsal ligament was identified.  This was then incised fully exposing the tendon and the abductor hallucis muscle.  This was then resected from his osseous attachments and a small tenotomy was performed.  At this time, a small lateral capsulotomy was also performed.  Lateral contractures were once again reevaluated and noted to be grossly reduced.,Attention was then directed to the dorsal aspect of the first metatarsal phalangeal joint where linear longitudinal and periosteal and capsular incisions were made following the first metatarsal joint and following the original shape of the skin incision.  The periosteal capsular layers were then reflected both medially and laterally from the head of the first metatarsal and a utilizing an oscillating bone saw, the head of the first metatarsal and medial eminence was resected and passed from the operative field.  A 0.045 inch K-wire was then driven across the first metatarsal head in order to act as an access dye.  The patient was then placed in the frog-leg position, and two osteotomy cuts were made, one from the access guide to the plantar proximal position and one from the access guide to the dorsal proximal position.  The dorsal arm was made longer than the plantar arm to accommodate for fixation.  At this time, the capital fragment was resected and shifted laterally into a more corrected position.  At this time, three portions of the 0.045-inch K-wire were placed across the osteotomy site in order to access temporary forms of fixation.  Two of the three of these K-wires were removed in sequence and following the standard AO technique two 3.4 x 15 mm and one 2.4 x 14 mm OsteoMed noncannulated screws were placed across the osteotomy site.  Compression was noted to be excellent.  All guide wires and 0.045-inch K-wires were then removed.  Utilizing an oscillating bone saw, the overhanging wedge of the bone on the medial side of the first metatarsal was resected and passed from the operating field.  The wound was then once again flushed with copious amounts of sterile normal saline.  At this time, utilizing both 2-0 and 3-0 Vicryl, the periosteal and capsular layers were then reapproximated.  At this time, the skin was then closed in layers utilizing 4-0 Vicryl and 4-0 nylon.  At this time, attention was directed to the dorsal aspect of the right fifth metatarsal where a linear longitudinal incision was made over the metatarsophalangeal joint just lateral to the extensor digitorum longus tension.  Incision was carried deep utilizing both sharp and blunt dissections and all major neurovascular structures were avoided.,A periosteal and capsular incision was then made on the lateral aspect of the extensor digitorum longus tendon and periosteum and capsular layers were then reflected medially and laterally from the head of the fifth metatarsal.  Utilizing an oscillating bone saw, the lateral eminence was resected and passed from the operative field.  Utilizing the sagittal saw, a Weil-type osteotomy was made at the fifth metatarsal head.  The head was then shifted medially into a more corrected position.  A 0.045-inch K-wire was then used as a temporary fixation, and a 2.0 x 10 mm OsteoMed noncannulated screw was placed across the osteotomy site.  This was noted to be in correct position and compression was noted to be excellent.  Utilizing a small bone rongeur, the overhanging wedge of the bone on the dorsal aspect of the fifth metatarsal was resected and passed from the operative field.  The wound was once again flushed with copious amounts of sterile normal saline.  The periosteal and capsular layers were reapproximated utilizing 3-0 Vicryl, and the skin was then closed utilizing 4-0 Vicryl and 4-0 nylon.  At this time, 10 mL of 0.5% Marcaine plain and 1 mL of dexamethasone phosphate were infiltrated about the surgical site.  The right foot was then dressed with Xeroform gauze, fluffs, Kling, and Ace wrap, all applied in mild compressive fashion.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was then deflated and a prompt hyperemic response was noted to all digits of the right foot.  The patient was then transported from the operating room to the recovery room with vital sings stable and neurovascular status grossly intact to the right foot.  After a brief period of postoperative monitoring, the patient was discharged to home with proper written and verbal discharge instructions, which included to keep dressing clean, dry, and intact and to follow up with Dr. A.  The patient is to be nonweightbearing to the right foot.  The patient was given a prescription for pain medications on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and was educated on these.  The patient tolerated the procedure and anesthesia well.  Dr. A was present throughout the entire case."

After obtaining the informed consent, the patient's posterior left chest wall was prepped and draped in usual fashion.  Xylocaine 1% was infiltrated above the seventh intercostal space in the midscapular line.  Initially, I tried to use the thoracentesis set after 1% Xylocaine had been infiltrated, but the needle of the system was just too short to reach the pleural cavity due to the patient's very thick chest wall.  Therefore, I had to use a #18 spinal needle, which I had to use almost in its entire length to reach the fluid.  From then on, I proceeded manually to withdraw 2000 mL of a light milky fluid.,The patient tolerated the procedure fairly well, but almost at the end of it she said that she was feeling like fainting and therefore we carefully withdrew the needle.  At that time, it was getting difficult to withdraw fluid anyway and we allowed her to lie down and after a few minutes the patient was feeling fine.  At any rate, we gave her bolus of 250 mL of normal saline and the patient returned to her room for additional hours of observation.  We then thought that if she was doing fine, then we will send her home.,A chest x-ray was performed after the procedure which showed a dramatic reduction of the amount of pleural fluid and then there was no pneumothorax or no other obvious complications of her procedure.,"

This was done under interscalene and subsequent general anesthetic in the modified beach chair position.,HISTORY AND GROSS FINDINGS: , The patient is a 48-year-old with male who has been suffering increasing right shoulder pain for a number of months prior to surgical intervention.  He was completely refractory to conservative outpatient therapy.  After discussing the alternative care as well as the advantages, disadvantages, risks, complications, and expectations, he elected to undergo the above stated procedure on this date.,Intraarticularly, the joint was observed.  There was noted to be a degenerative glenoid labrum tear.  The biceps complex was otherwise intact.  There were minimal degenerative changes at the glenohumeral joint.  Rotator cuff tear was appreciated on the inner surface.  Subacromially, the same was true.  This was an elliptical to V-type tear.  The patient has a grossly positive type III acromion.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient was laid supine on the operating table after receiving interscalene and then general anesthetic by the Anesthesia Department.  He was safely placed in modified beach chair position.  He was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  Portals were created outside to end, posterior to anterior, and ultimately laterally in the typical fashion.  Upon complete diagnostic arthroscopy was carried out in the intraarticular aspect of the joint, a 4.2 meniscus shaver was placed anteriorly with the scope posteriorly.  Debridement was carried out to the glenoid labrum.  The biceps was probed and noted to be intact.  Undersurface of the rotator cuff was debrided with the shaver along with debridement of the subchondral region of the greater tuberosity attachment.,After this, instrumentation was removed.  The scope was placed subacromially and a lateral portal created.  Gross bursectomy was carried out in a stepwise fashion to the top part of the cuff as well as in the gutters.  An anterolateral portal was created.  Sutures were placed via express silk as well as other sutures with a #2 fiber wire.  With passing of the suture, they were tied with a slip-tight knot and then two half stitches.  There was excellent reduction of the tear.  Superolateral portal was then created.  A #1 Mitek suture anchor was then placed in the posterior cuff to bring this over to bleeding bone.  _______ suture was placed.  The implant was put into place.  The loop was grabbed and it was impacted in the previously drilled holes.  There was excellent reduction of the tear.,Trial range of motion was carried out and seemed to be satisfactory.,Prior to this, a subacromial decompression was accomplished after release of CA ligament with the vapor Bovie.  A 4.8 motorized barrel burr was utilized to sequentially take this down from the type III acromion to a flat type I acromion.,After all was done, copious irrigation was carried out throughout the joint.  Gross bursectomy lightly was carried out to remove all bony elements.  A pain buster catheter was placed through a separate portal and cut to length.  0.5% Marcaine was instilled after portals were closed with #4-0 nylon.

Preoperative evaluation included a CT scan, which showed focal mass.  CT and PET confirmed anterior lesion.  Therefore the patient was seen in our thoracic tumor board where it was recommended to have resection performed with chest wall reconstruction.  In the outpatient setting, the patient was willing to proceed.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED IN DETAIL: , After informed consent was obtained, the patient identified correctly.  She was taken to the operating room where an epidural catheter was placed by Anesthesia without difficulty.  She was sedated and intubated with double-lumen endotracheal tube without difficulty.  She was positioned with left side up.  Appropriate pressure points were padded.  The left chest was prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  The skin incision was made in the posterior axillary line, approximately 7th intercostal space with #10 blade, taken down through tissues and Bovie electrocautery.,Pleura was entered.  There was good deflation of the left lung.  __________ port was placed, followed by the 0-degree 10-mm scope with appropriate patient positioning.  Posteriorly a pedunculated 2.5 x 3-cm pleural-based mass was identified on the anterior chest wall.  There were thin adhesions to the pleura, but no invasion of the chest wall that could be identified.  The tumor was very mobile and was on a pedunculated stalk, approximately 1.5 cm.  It was felt that this could be resected without the need of chest wall reconstruction because of the narrow stalk.,Therefore a 2nd port was placed in the anterior axillary line approximately 8th intercostal space in the usual fashion.  Camera was placed through this port.  Laparoscopic scissors were placed through the posterior port, but it was necessary to have another instrument to provide more tension than just gravity.  Therefore because of the need to bring the specimen through the chest wall, a small 3-cm thoracotomy was made, which incorporated the posterior port site.  This was taken down to the subcutaneous tissue with Bovie electrocautery.  Periosteal elevator was used to lift the intercostal muscle off.  The ribs were not spread.  Through this 3-cm incision, both the laparoscopic scissors as well as Prestige graspers could be placed.  Prestige graspers were used to pull the specimen from the chest wall.  Care was taken not to injure the capsule.  The laparoscopic scissors on cautery were used to resect the parietal pleural off of the chest wall.  Care was taken not to transect the stalk.  Specimen came off the chest wall very easily.  There was good hemostasis.,At this point, the EndoCatch bag was placed through the incision.  Specimen was placed in the bag and then removed from the field.  There was good hemostasis.  Camera was removed.  A 24-French chest tube was placed through the anterior port and secured with 2-0 silk suture.  The posterior port site was closed 1st with 2-0 Vicryl in a running fashion for the intercostal muscle layer, followed by 2-0 closure of the latissimus fascia as well as subdermal suture, 4-0 Monocryl was used for the skin, followed by Steri-Strips and sterile drapes.  The patient tolerated the procedure well, was extubated in the operating room and returned to the recovery room in stable condition."

The right frontal area and right retroauricular area was shaved and then the head, neck, chest and abdomen were prepped and draped out in the routine manner.  The old scalp incision was opened with a Colorado needle tip and the old catheter was identified as we took the Colorado needle tip over the existing ventricular catheter, right over the sleeve on top of it and when that was entered, the CSF poured out around the ventricular catheter.  The ventricular catheter was then disconnected from the reservoir and endoscopically explored.  We saw it was blocked up proximally.  The catheter was a little adherent and required some freeing up with coagulation and on twisting of the ventricular catheter, I was able to free up the ventricular catheter, and endoscopically inserted a new Bactiseal ventricular catheter.  The catheter went down to the septum and I could see both the right and left lateral ventricles and elected to pass it into the right lateral ventricle.  It irrigated out well.  There was minimal amount of bleeding, but not significant.  The distal catheter system was tested.  There was good distal run off.  Therefore, a linear skin incision was made in the retroauricular area.  Tunneling was performed between the two incisions and a ProGAV valve set to an opening pressure of 10 with a 1-5 shunt assist was brought through the subgaleal tissue, connected to the distal catheter and a flushing reservoir was interposed between the burr hole site ventricular catheter and the ProGAV valve.  All connections were secured with 2-0 Ethibond sutures.  Careful attention was made to make sure that the ProGAV was in the right orientation.  The wounds were irrigated out with Bacitracin, closed in a routine manner using Vicryl for the deep layers and Monocryl for the skin, followed by Mastisol and Steri-Strips.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  He was awakened, extubated and taken to recovery room in satisfactory condition."

He has underlying sinus bradycardia.  Therefore, will likely be pacing much of the time and would benefit from a biventricular pacing device.,RISKS AND BENEFITS:,  Risks, benefits, and alternatives to implantation of biventricular AICD and defibrillation threshold testing were discussed with the patient.  Risks including but not limited to bleeding, infection, vascular injury, cardiac perforation, stroke, myocardial infarction, the need for urgent cardiovascular surgery, and death were discussed with the patient.  The patient agreed both verbally and via written consent.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was transported to the cardiac catheterization laboratory in the fasting state.  The region of the left deltopectoral groove was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  Lidocaine 1% (20 mL) was administered to the area.  After achieving appropriate anesthesia, a percutaneous access of the left axillary vein was performed under fluoroscopy with two separate sticks.  Guidewires were advanced down into the left axillary vein.  Following this, a 4-inch long transverse incision was made through the skin and subcutaneous tissue exposing the pectoral fascia and muscle beneath.  Hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery.  Lidocaine 1% (10 mL) was administered to the medial aspect of the incision and a pocket was fashioned in the medial direction.  Using the more lateral of the guidewires, a 7-French side-arm sheath was advanced into the left axillary vein.  The dilator was removed and another wire was advanced down into the sheath.  The sheath was then backed up over the top of the two wires.  One wire was pinned to the drape and using the alternate wire, a 9-French side-arm sheath was advanced down into the left axillary vein.  The dilator and wire were removed.  A defibrillation lead was then advanced down into the atrium.  The peel-away sheath was removed.  The lead was then passed across the tricuspid valve and positioned in the apical septal location.  The active fix screw was deployed.  Adequate pacing and sensing functions were established.  A 10-volt pacing was used temporarily and there was no diaphragmatic stimulation.  The suture sleeve was advanced to the entry point of the tissue and connected securely to the tissue.  Using the wire that had been pinned to the drape, a 7-French side-arm sheath was advanced over this wire into the axillary vein.  The wire and dilator were removed.  An active pacing lead was then advanced down to the right atrium and the peel-away sheath was removed.  The lead was parked until a later time.  Using the separate access point, a 9-French side-arm sheath was advanced into the left axillary vein.  The dilator and wire were removed.  A curved outer sheath catheter as well as an inner catheter were advanced down into the area of the coronary sinus.  The coronary sinus was cannulated.  Inner catheter was removed and a balloon-tipped catheter was advanced into the coronary sinus.  A coronary sinus venogram was then performed.  It was noted that the most suitable location for lead placement was the middle cardiac vein.  This was cannulated and a passive lead was advanced over a Whisper EDS wire into a distal position.  Adequate pacing and sensing functions were established.  A 10-volt pacing was used temporarily.  There was no diaphragmatic stimulation.  The outer sheath was peeled away.  The 9 French sheath was then peeled away.  Suture sleeve was advanced to the entry point of the tissue and connected securely to the tissue.  At this point, the atrial lead was then positioned in the right atrial appendage using a preformed J-curved stylet.  The lead body was turned several times and the lead was affixed to the tissue.  Adequate pacing and sensing function were established.  A suture sleeve was advanced to the entry point of the tissue and connected securely to the tissue.  The pocket was then washed with antibiotic-impregnated saline.  Pulse generator was obtained and connected securely to the leads.  The leads were carefully wrapped behind the pulse generator and the entire system was placed in the pocket.  The pocket was then closed with 2-0, 3-0, and 4-0 Vicryl using a running mattress stitch.  Sponge and needle counts were correct at the end of the procedure and no acute complications were noted.,The patient was sedated further and shock on T was performed on two separate occasions.

He reported to the Hospital the day after his altercation complaining of mall occlusion and sore left shoulder.  He was worked up by the emergency department.  His head CT was cleared and his left shoulder was clear of any fractures or soft tissue damage.  Oral maxillary facial surgery was consulted to manage the mandible fracture.  After review of the CT and examination it was determined that the patient would benefit from open reduction, internal fixation of bilateral mandible fractures.  Risks, benefits, and alternative to treatment were thoroughly discussed with the patient and consent was obtained.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:, The patient was brought to the operating room #2 at Hospital.  He was laid in supine position on the operating room table.  ASA monitors were attached and stated general anesthesia was induced with IV anesthetic and maintained with nasal endotracheal intubation and inflation anesthetics.,The patient was prepped and draped in the usual oral maxillofacial surgery fashion.  The surgeon approached the operating room table in a sterile fashion.  Approximately 10 mL of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine was injected into oral vestibule in a nerve block fashion.  Erich arch bars were adapted to the maxilla and mandible, secured in the posterior teeth with 24-gauge surgical steel wire and 26-gauge surgical steel wire in the anterior.  This was done from second molar to second molar on both the maxilla and the mandible secondary to the patient missing multiple teeth.  The patient was manipulated up into maximum intercuspation.  He has a malocclusion with severe bruxism and so wear facets were lined up.  This was secured with 26-gauge surgical steel wire.  Attention was then directed to the symphysis extraorally.  Approximately 5 mL of 1% lidocaine with epinephrine was injected into the area of incision which paralleled the inferior border of the mandible 2 cm below the inferior border of the mandible.,After waiting appropriate time for local anesthesia using a 15 blade, a skin and platysma incision was made.  Then using a series of blunt and sharp dissections, the dissection was carried to the inferior border of the mandible.  The periosteum was incised and reflected with the periosteal elevator.  The fracture was noted and it was displaced.  Manipulation of the segments and checking with the occlusion intraorally, the fracture was aligned.  This was secured with 7-hole 2.3 titanium locking reconstruction plate with bicortical screws.  The wound was then packed with moist Ray-Tec and attention was directed intraorally to the left angle fracture.  Approximately 5 mL of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine was injected into the left vestibule.  After waiting appropriate time for local anesthesia to take effect, using Bovie electrocautery, a sagittal split incision was made and the fracture was identified.  It was noted that the fracture went through tooth #17 and this needed to be extracted.  Taking a round bur, a buckle trough was made and the tooth was elevated and removed both distal and mesial roots.  The fracture was then reduced and lateral superior border plate 2-0 4 whole with monocortical screws was placed.  The fracture was noted to be well reduced.  The wound was then irrigated with copious amount of sterile water.  The patient was released for excellent intercuspation.  He was then manipulated up into the occlusion easily.  Wound was then closed with running 3-0 chromic gut suture.  Attention was then directed extraorally.  This was irrigated with copious amount of sterile water and closed in a layer fashion with 3-0 Vicryl, 4-0 Vicryl, and 5-0 Prolene on skin.  Attention was then again directed into the mouth.  The throat pack was removed and orogastric tube was placed and stomach content was evacuated.  The patient was then manipulated back up to maximum intercuspation and secured with interdental elastics and a pressure dressing was applied to the extraoral incisions.  At this point, the procedure was then determined to be over.,The patient was extubated and breathing spontaneously, transported to the PACU in excellent condition."
240," A right-handed female with longstanding intermittent right low back pain, who was involved in a motor vehicle accident with no specific injury at that time. ", EMG/Nerve Conduction Study - 3 ,"HISTORY: , The patient is a 56-year-old right-handed female with longstanding intermittent right low back pain, who was involved in a motor vehicle accident in September of 2005.  At that time, she did not notice any specific injury.  Five days later, she started getting abnormal right low back pain.  At this time, it radiates into the buttocks down the posterior aspect of her thigh and into the right lateral aspect of her calf.  Symptoms are worse when sitting for any length of time, such as driving a motor vehicle.  Mild symptoms when walking for long periods of time.  Relieved by standing and lying down.  She denies any left leg symptoms or right leg weakness.  No change in bowel or bladder function.  Symptoms have slowly progressed.  She has had Medrol Dosepak and analgesics, which have not been very effective.  She underwent a spinal epidural injection, which was effective for the first few hours, but she had recurrence of the pain by the next day.  This was done four and a half weeks ago.,On examination, lower extremities strength is full and symmetric.  Straight leg raising is normal.,OBJECTIVE:,  Sensory examination is normal to all modalities.  Full range of movement of lumbosacral spine.  Mild tenderness over lumbosacral paraspinal muscles and sacroiliac joint.  Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ and symmetric at the knees, 2 at the left ankle and 1+ at the right ankle.,NERVE CONDUCTION STUDIES:,  Motor and sensory distal latencies, evoked response, amplitudes, conduction velocities, and F-waves are normal in the lower extremities.  Right tibial H-reflex is slightly prolonged when compared to the left tibial H-reflex.,NEEDLE EMG:,  Needle EMG was performed in both lower extremities and lumbosacral paraspinal muscles using the disposable concentric needle.  It revealed increased insertional activity in the right mid and lower lumbosacral paraspinal muscles as well as right peroneus longus muscle.  There were signs of chronic denervation in right tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, gastrocnemius medialis, and left gastrocnemius medialis muscles.,IMPRESSION: , This electrical study is abnormal.  It reveals the following:,1.  A mild right L5 versus S1 radiculopathy.,2.  Left S1 nerve root irritation.  There is no evidence of active radiculopathy.,3.  There is no evidence of plexopathy, myopathy or peripheral neuropathy.,MRI of the lumbosacral spine was personally reviewed and reveals bilateral L5-S1 neuroforaminal stenosis, slightly worse on the right.  Results were discussed with the patient and her daughter.  I would recommend further course of spinal epidural injections with Dr. XYZ.  If she has no response, then surgery will need to be considered.  She agrees with this approach and will followup with you in the near future."
241," Numbness and tingling in the right upper extremity, intermittent and related to the positioning of the wrist.  Carpal tunnel syndrome suspected.", SOAP - Numbness & Tingling ,"SUBJECTIVE: , This patient presents to the office today because of some problems with her right hand.  It has been going tingling and getting numb periodically over several weeks.  She just recently moved her keyboard down at work.  She is hoping that will help.  She is worried about carpal tunnel.  She does a lot of repetitive type activities.  It is worse at night.  If she sleeps on it a certain way, she will wake up and it will be tingling then she can usually shake out the tingling, but nonetheless it is very bothersome for her.  It involves mostly the middle finger, although, she says it also involves the first and second digits on the right hand.  She has some pain in her thumb as well.  She thinks that could be arthritis.,OBJECTIVE: , Weight 213.2 pounds, blood pressure 142/84, pulse 92, respirations 16.  General:  The patient is nontoxic and in no acute distress.  Musculoskeletal:  The right hand was examined.  It appears to be within normal limits and the appearance is similar to the left hand.  She has good and equal grip strength noted bilaterally.  She has negative Tinel's bilaterally.  She has a positive Phalen's test.  The fingers on the right hand are neurovascularly intact with a normal capillary refill.,ASSESSMENT:  ,Numbness and tingling in the right upper extremity, intermittent and related to the positioning of the wrist.  I suspect carpal tunnel syndrome.,PLAN:  ,The patient is going to use Anaprox double strength one pill every 12 hours with food as well as a cock-up wrist splint.  We are going to try this for two weeks and if the condition is still present, then we are going to proceed with EMG test at that time.  She is going to let me know.  While she is here, I am going to also get her the blood test she needs for her diabetes.  I am noting that her blood pressure is elevated, but improved from the last visit.  I also noticed that she has lost a lot of weight.  She is working on diet and exercise and she is doing a great job.  Right now for the blood pressure we are going to continue to observe as she carries forward additional measures in her diet and exercise to lose more weight and I expect the blood pressure will continue to improve."

We decided go ahead with anterior cervical discectomy at C5-C6 and fusion.  The risks of lack of pain relief, paralysis, hoarse voice, nerve injuries, and infection were explained and the patient agreed to proceed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room where a general endotracheal anesthesia was induced without complication.  The patient was placed in the slightly extended position with the neck and the head was restrained in a doughnut and the occiput was restrained by the doughnut.  He had tape placed over the shoulders during intraoperative x-rays and his elbows were well padded.  The tape was placed and his arms were well padded.  He was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  A linear incision was fashioned at the cricothyroid level from near the midline to over the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  We separated the platysma from the subcutaneous tissue and then opened the platysma along the medial border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  We then dissected sharply medial to carotid artery, which we palpated to the prevertebral region.  We placed Caspar retractors for medial and lateral exposure over the C5-C6 disc space, which we confirmed with the lateral cervical spine x-ray including 18-gauge needle in the disc space.  We then marked the disc space.  We then drilled off ventral osteophyte as well as osteophyte creating concavity within the disc space.  We then under magnification removed all the disc material, we could possibly see down to bleeding bone and both the endplates.  We took down posterior longitudinal ligament as well.  We incised the 6-mm cornerstone bone.  We placed a 6-mm parallel medium bone nicely into the disc space.  We then sized a 23-mm plate.  We inserted the screws nicely above and below.  We tightened down the lock-nuts.  We irrigated the wound.  We assured hemostasis using bone wax prior to placing the plate.  We then assured hemostasis once again.  We reapproximated the platysma using 3-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted fashion.  The subcutaneous level was closed using 3-0 Vicryl in a simple buried fashion.  The skin was closed with 3-0 Monocryl in a running subcuticular stitch.  Steri-Strips were applied.  Dry sterile dressing with Telfa was applied over this.  We obtained an intraoperative x-ray to confirm the proper level and good position of both plates and screw construct on the lateral x-ray and the patient was transferred to the recovery room, moving all four extremities with stable vital signs.  I was present as a primary surgeon throughout the entire case."

Symptoms are predominantly sensory and severely dysfunctioning, with the patient having inability to ambulate independently as well as difficulty with grip and temperature differentiation in his upper extremities.  ", Neurologic Consultation - 4 ,"REASON FOR NEUROLOGICAL CONSULTATION:,  Muscle twitching, clumsiness, progressive pain syndrome, and gait disturbance.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 62-year-old African-American male with a significant past medical history of diabetes, hypertension, previous stroke in 2002 with minimal residual right-sided weakness as well as two MIs, status post pacemaker insertion who first presented with numbness in his lower extremities in 2001.  He states that since that time these symptoms have been progressive and now involving his legs above his knees as well as his hands.  More recently, he describes a burning sensation along with numbness.  This has become a particular problem and of all the problems he has he feels that pain is his primary concern.  Over the last six months, he has noticed that he cannot feel hot objects in his hands and that objects slip out of his hands.  He denies any weakness per se, just clumsiness and decreased sensation.  He has also been complaining of brief muscle jerks, which occur in both hands and his shoulders.  This has been a fairly longstanding problem, and again has become more prevalent recently.  He does not have any tremor.  He denies any neck pain.  He walks with the aid of a walker because of unsteadiness with gait.,Recently, he has tried gabapentin, but this was not effective for pain control.  Oxycodone helps somewhat and gives him at least three hours pain relief.  Because of the pain, he has significant problems with fractured sleep.  He states he has not had a good night's sleep in many years.  About six months ago, after an MI and pacemaker insertion, he was transferred to a nursing facility.  At that facility, his insulin was stopped.  Since then he has only been on oral medication for his diabetes.  He denies any back pain, neck pain, change in bowel or bladder function, or specific injury pre-dating these symptoms., ,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, stroke, arthritis, GERD, and headaches.,MEDICATIONS: , Trazodone, simvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide, Prevacid, lisinopril, glipizide, and gabapentin.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Discussed above and documented on the chart.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , Discussed above and documented on the chart.

Motor examination reveals mild atrophy in bilateral FDIs, but still has a strong grip.  Individual muscle strength is close to normal with only subtle weakness found in ankle plantar and dorsiflexion.  Tone and bulk are normal.  Sensory examination reveals a severe decrease to all modalities in his lower extremities from just above the knees distally.  He has no vibration sense at his knees.  Similarly, there is decrease to all sensory modalities in his both upper extremities from just above the wrist distally.  The only reflexes I could obtain with trace reflexes in his biceps.  Remaining reflexes were unelicitable.  No Babinski.  The patient walks normally with the aid of a cane.  He has severe sensory ataxia with inability to walk unaided.  Positive Romberg with eyes open and closed.,IMPRESSION AND PLAN:,1.  Probable painful diabetic neuropathy.  Symptoms are predominantly sensory and severely dysfunctioning, with the patient having inability to ambulate independently as well as difficulty with grip and temperature differentiation in his upper extremities.  He has relative preservation of motor function.  Because these symptoms are progressive and, by report, he came off his insulin, suggesting somewhat mild diabetes, I would like to rule out other causes of progressive neuropathy.,2.  He has history of myoclonic jerks.  I did not see any on my examination today and I feel that these are benign and probably secondary to his severe insomnia, which he states is secondary to the painful neuropathy.  I would like to rule out other causes such as hepatic encephalopathy., ,I have recommended the following:,1.  EMG/nerve conduction study to assess severity of neuropathy and to characterize neuropathy.,2.  Blood work, looking for other causes of neuropathy and myoclonus, to include CBC, CMP, TSH, LFT, B12, RPR, ESR, Lyme titer, and HbA1c, and ammonia level.,3.  Neurontin and oxycodone have not been effective, and I have recommended Cymbalta starting at 30 mg q.d. for five days and then increasing to 60 mg q.d.  Side effect profile of this medication was discussed with the patient.,4.  I have explained to him that progression of diabetic neuropathy is closely related to diabetic control and I have recommended tight diabetic control.,5.  I will see him at followup at the EMG."

Femoral head 32 mm diameter +0 mm neck length.,4.  Alloclassic SL offset stem uncemented for taper.,ANESTHESIA: , Spinal.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  The patient was brought into the operating room and was placed on the operative table in a lateral decubitus position with the right side up.  After review of allergies, antibiotics were administered and time out was performed.  The right lower extremity was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  A 15 cm to 25 cm in length, an incision was made over the greater trochanter.  This was angled posteriorly.  Access to the tensor fascia lata was performed.  This was incised with the use of scissors.  Gluteus maximus was separated.  The bursa around the hip was identified, and the bleeders were coagulated with the use of Bovie.  Hemostasis was achieved.  The piriformis fossa was identified, and the piriformis fossa tendon was elevated with the use of a Cobb.  It was detached from the piriformis fossa and tagged with 2-0 Vicryl.  Access to the capsule was performed.  The capsule was excised from the posterior and superior aspects.  It was released also in the front with the use of a Mayo scissors.  The hip was then dislocated.  With the use of an oscillating saw, the femoral neck cut was performed.  The acetabulum was then visualized and debrided from soft tissues and osteophytes.  Reaming was initiated and completed for a 48 mm diameter cap without complications.  The trial component was put in place and was found to be stable in an anatomic position.  The actual component was then impacted in the acetabulum.  A 10-degree lip polyethylene was also placed in the acetabular cap.  Our attention was then focused to the femur.  With the use of a cookie cutter, the femoral canal was accessed.  The broaching process was initiated for No.4 trial component.  Trialing of the hip with the hip flexed at 90 degrees and internally rotated to 30 degrees did not demonstrate any obvious instability or dislocation.  In addition, in full extension and external rotation, there was no dislocation.  The actual component was inserted in place and hemostasis was achieved again.  The wound was irrigated with normal saline.  The wound was then closed in layers.  Before performing that the medium-sized Hemovac drain was placed in the wound.  The tensor fascia lata was closed with 0 PDS and the wound was closed with 2-0 Monocryl.  Staples were used for the skin.  The patient recovered from anesthesia without complications.,EBL: , 50 mL.,IV FLUIDS: , 2 liters.,DRAINS: , One medium-sized Hemovac.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,DISPOSITION: , The patient was transferred to the PACU in stable condition.  She will be weightbearing as tolerated to the right lower extremity with posterior hip precautions.  We will start the DVT prophylaxis after the removal of the epidural catheter."
245, Pain management for post-laminectomy low back syndrome and radiculopathy.  , Pain Management Consult - 1 ,"Mr. XYZ forgot his hearing aids at home today and is severely hearing impaired and most of the interview had to be conducted with me yelling at him at the top of my voice.  For all these reasons, this was not really under the best circumstances and I had to curtail the amount of time I spent trying to get a history because of the physical effort required in extracting information from this patient.  The patient was seen late because he had not filled in the patient questionnaire.  To summarize the history here, Mr. XYZ who is not very clear on events from the past, sustained a work-related injury some time in 1998.  At that time, he was driving an 18-wheeler truck.  The patient indicated that he slipped off the rear of his truck while loading vehicles to his trailer.  He experienced severe low back pain and eventually a short while later, underwent a fusion of L4-L5 and L5-S1.  The patient had an uneventful hospital course from the surgery, which was done somewhere in Florida by a surgeon, who he does not remember.  He was able to return to his usual occupation, but then again had a second work-related injury in May of 2005.  At that time, he was required to boat trucks to his rig and also to use a chain-pulley system to raise and lower the vehicles.  Mr. XYZ felt a popping sound in his back and had excruciating low back pain and had to be transported to the nearest hospital.  He was MRI'ed at that time, which apparently showed a re-herniation of an L5-S1 disc and then, he somehow ended up in Houston, where he underwent fusion by Dr. W from L3 through S2.  This was done on 12/15/2005.  Initially, he did fairly well and was able to walk and move around, but then gradually the pain reappeared and he started getting severe left-sided leg pain going down the lateral aspect of the left leg into his foot.  He is still complaining of the severe pain right now with tingling in the medial two toes of the foot and significant weakness in his left leg.  The patient was referred to Dr. A, pain management specialist and Dr. A has maintained him on opioid medications consisting of Norco 10/325 mg for breakthrough pain and oxycodone 30 mg t.i.d. with Lunesta 3 mg q.h.s. for sleep, Carisoprodol 350 mg t.i.d., and Lyrica 100 mg q.daily.  The patient states that he is experiencing no side effects from medications and takes medications as required.  He has apparently been drug screened and his drug screening has been found to be normal.  The patient underwent an extensive behavioral evaluation on 05/22/06 by TIR Rehab Center.  At that time, it was felt that Mr. XYZ showed a degree of moderate level of depression.  There were no indications in the evaluation that Mr. XYZ showed any addictive or noncompliant type behaviors.  It was felt at that time that Mr. XYZ would benefit from a brief period of individual psychotherapy and a course of psychotropic medications.  Of concern to the therapist at that time was the patient's untreated and unmonitored hypertension and diabetes.  Mr. XYZ indicated at that time, they had not purchased any prescription medications or any of these health-related issues because of financial limitations.  He still apparently is not under really good treatment for either of these conditions and on today's evaluation, he actually denies that he had diabetes.  The impression was that the patient had axis IV diagnosis of chronic functional limitations, financial loss, and low losses with no axis III diagnosis.  This was done by Rhonda Ackerman, Ph.D., a psychologist.  It was also suggested at that time that the patient should quit smoking.  Despite these evaluations, Mr. XYZ really did not get involved in psychotherapy and there was poor attendance of these visits, there was no clearance given for any surgical interventions and it was felt that the patient has benefited from the use of SSRIs.  Of concern in June of 2006 was that the patient had still not stopped smoking despite warnings.  His hypertension and diabetes were still not under good control and the patient was assessed at significant risk for additional health complications including stroke, reduced mental clarity, and future falls.  It was felt that any surgical interventions should be put on hold at that time.  In September of 2006, the patient was evaluated at Baylor College of Medicine in the Occupational Health Program.  The evaluation was done by a physician at that time, whose report is clearly documented in the record.  Evaluation was done by Dr. B.  At present, Mr. XYZ continues on with his oxycodone and Norco.  These were prescribed by Dr. A two and a half weeks ago and the patient states that he has enough medication left to last him for about another two and a half weeks.  The patient states that there has been no recent change in either the severity or the distribution of his pain.  He is unable to sleep because of pain and his activities of daily living are severely limited.  He spends most of his day lying on the floor, watching TV and occasionally will walk a while.  ***** from detailed questioning shows that his activities of daily living are practically zero.  The patient denies smoking at this time.  He denies alcohol use or aberrant drug use.  He obtains no pain medications from no other sources.  Review of MRI done on 02/10/06 shows laminectomies at L3 through S1 with bilateral posterior plates and pedicle screws with granulation tissue around the thecal sac and around the left L4-5 and S1 nerve roots, which appear to be retracted posteriorly.  There is a small right posterior herniation at L1-L2.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Significant for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.  The patient does not know what medications he is taking for diabetes and denies any diabetes.  CABG in July of 2006 with no preoperative angina, shortness of breath, or myocardial infarction.  History of depression, lumbar fusion surgery in 2000, left knee surgery 25 years ago.,SOCIAL HISTORY:,  The patient is on disability.  He does not smoke.  He does not drink alcohol.  He is single.  He lives with a girlfriend.  He has minimal activities of daily living.  The patient cannot recollect when last a urine drug screen was done.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  No fevers, no headaches, chest pain, nausea, shortness of breath, or change in appetite.  Depressive symptoms of crying and decreased self-worth have been noted in the past.  No neurological history of strokes, epileptic seizures.  Genitourinary negative.  Gastrointestinal negative.  Integumentary negative.  Behavioral, depression.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,  The patient is short of hearing.  His cognitive skills appear to be significantly impaired.  The patient is oriented x3 to time and place.  Weight 185 pounds, temperature 97.5, blood pressure 137/92, pulse 61.  The patient is complaining of pain of a 9/10.,Musculoskeletal:  The patient's gait is markedly antalgic with predominant weightbearing on the left leg.  There is marked postural deviation to the left.  Because of pain, the patient is unable to heel-toe or tandem gait.  Examination of the neck and cervical spine are within normal limits.  Range of motion of the elbow, shoulders are within normal limits.  No muscle spasm or abnormal muscle movements noted in the neck and upper extremities.  Head is normocephalic.  Examination of the anterior neck is within normal limits.  There is significant muscle wasting of the quadriceps and hamstrings on the left, as well as of the calf muscles.  Skin is normal.  Hair distribution normal.  Skin temperature normal in both the upper and lower extremities.  The lumbar spine curvature is markedly flattened.  There is a well-healed central scar extending from T12 to L1.  The patient exhibits numerous positive Waddell's signs on exam of the low back with inappropriate flinching and wincing with even the lightest touch on the paraspinal muscles.  Examination of the paraspinal muscles show a mild to moderate degree of spasm with a significant degree of tenderness and guarding, worse on the left than the right.  Range of motion testing of the lumbar spine is labored in all directions.  It is interesting that the patient cannot flex more than 5  in the standing position, but is able to sit without any problem.  There is a marked degree of sciatic notch tenderness on the left.  No abnormal muscle spasms or muscle movements were noted.  Patrick's test is negative bilaterally.  There are no provocative facetal signs in either the left or right quadrants of the lumbar area.  Neurological exam:  Cranial nerves II through XII are within normal limits.  Neurological exam of the upper extremities is within normal limits with good motor strength and normal biceps, triceps and brachioradialis reflexes.  Neurological exam of the lower extremities shows a 2+ right patellar reflex and -1 on the left.  There is no ankle clonus.  Babinski is negative.  Sensory testing shows a minimal degree of sensory loss on the right L5 distribution.  Muscle testing shows decreased L4-L5 on the left with extensor hallucis longus +2/5.  Ankle extensors are -3 on the left and +5 on the right.  Dorsiflexors of the left ankle are +2 on the left and +5 on the right.  Straight leg raising test is positive on the left at about 35 .  There is no ankle clonus.  Hoffman's test and Tinel's test are normal in the upper extremities.,Respiratory:  Breath sounds normal.  Trachea is midline.,Cardiovascular:  Heart sounds normal.  No gallops or murmurs heard.  Carotid pulses present.  No carotid bruits.  Peripheral pulses are palpable.,Abdomen:  Hernia site is intact.  No hepatosplenomegaly.  No masses.  No areas of tenderness or guarding.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Post-laminectomy low back syndrome.,2.  Left L5-S1 radiculopathy.,3.  Severe cognitive impairment with minimal ***** for rehabilitation or return to work.,4.  Opioid dependence for pain control.,TREATMENT PLAN:,  The patient will continue on with his medications prescribed by Dr. Chang and I will see him in two weeks' time and probably suggest switching over from OxyContin to methadone.  I do not think this patient is a good candidate for spinal cord stimulation due to his grasp of exactly what is happening and his cognitive impairment.  I will get a behavioral evaluation from Mr. Tom Welbeck and refer the patient for ongoing physical therapy.  The prognosis here for any improvement or return to work is zero."

Partial metatarsectomy, right foot.,HISTORY:  ,This 41-year-old Caucasian female who presents to ABCD General Hospital with the above chief complaint.  The patient states that she has extreme pain over the navicular bone with shoe gear as well as history of multiple osteochondromas of unknown origin.  She states that she has been diagnosed with hereditary osteochondromas.  She has had previous dissection of osteochondromas in the past and currently has not been diagnosed in her feet as well as spine and back.  The patient desires surgical treatment at this time.,PROCEDURE:  ,An IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area.  The patient was transported to the operating room and placed on operating table in the supine position with a safety belt across her lap.  Copious amounts of Webril were placed on the left ankle followed by a blood pressure cuff.  After adequate sedation by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 5 cc of 1:1 mixture of 1% lidocaine plain and 0.5% Marcaine plain were injected in the diamond block type fashion around the navicular bone as well as the fifth metatarsal.  Foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion.,Foot was elevated from the operating table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was then inflated to 250 mmHg.  The foot was lowered as well as the operating table.  The sterile stockinet was reflected and the foot was cleansed with wet and dry sponge.  Attention was then directed to the navicular region on the right foot.  The area was palpated until the bony prominence was noted.  A curvilinear incision was made over the area of bony prominence.  At that time, a total of 10 cc with addition of 1% additional lidocaine plain was injected into the surgical site.  The incision was then deepened with #15 blade.  All vessels encountered were ligated for hemostasis.  The dissection was carried down to the level of the capsule and periosteum.  A linear incision was made over the navicular bone obliquely from proximal dorsal to distal plantar over the navicular bone.  The periosteum and the capsule were then reflected from the navicular bone at this time.  A bony prominence was noted both medially and plantarly to the navicular bone.  An osteotome and mallet were then used to resect the enlarged portion of the navicular bone.  After resection with an osteotome there was noted to be a large plantar shelf.  The surrounding soft tissues were then freed from this plantar area.  Care was taken to protect the attachments of the posterior tibial tendon as much as possible.  Only minimal resection of its attachment to the fiber was performed in order to expose the bone.  Sagittal saw was then used to resect the remaining plantar medial prominent bone.  The area was then smoothed with reciprocating rasp until no sharp edges were noted.  The area was flushed with copious amount of sterile saline at which time there was noted to be a palpable ________ where the previous bony prominence had been noted.  The area was then again flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline and the capsule and periosteum were then reapproximated with #3-0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissues were then reapproximated with #4-0 Vicryl to reduce tension from the incision and running #5-0 Vicryl subcuticular stitch was performed.,Attention was then directed to the fifth metatarsal.  There was noted to be a palpable bony prominence dorsally with fifth metatarsal head as well as radiographic evidence laterally of an osteochondroma at the neck of the fifth metatarsal.  Approximately 7 cm incision was made dorsolaterally over the fifth metatarsal.  The incision was then deepened with #15 blade.  Care was taken to preserve the extensor tendon.  The incision was then created over the capsule and periosteum of the fifth metatarsal head.  Capsule and periosteum were reflected both dorsally, laterally, and plantarly.  At that time, there was noted to be a visible osteochondroma on the plantar lateral aspect of the fifth metatarsal neck as well as on the dorsal aspect of the head of the fifth metatarsal.  A sagittal saw was used to resect both of these osteal prominences.,All remaining sharp edges were then smoothed with reciprocating rasp.  The area was inspected for the remaining bony prominences and none was noted.  The area was flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  The capsule and periosteum were then reapproximated with #3-0 Vicryl.  Subcutaneous closure was then performed with #4-0 Vicryl in order to reduce tension around the incision line.  Running #5-0 subcutaneous stitch was then performed.  Steri-Strips were applied to both surgical sites.  Dressings consisted of Adaptic, soaked in Betadine, 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and the hyperemic flush was noted to all five digits of the right foot.,The patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well without complications.  The patient was transferred to the PACU with vital signs stable and vascular status intact.  The patient was given postoperative pain prescription and instructed to be partially weightbearing with crutches as tolerated.  The patient is to follow-up with Dr. X in his office as directed or sooner if any problems or questions arise."

The patient received 6 mL of 0.25% Marcaine local anesthetic on each side.,TOURNIQUET TIME:  ,Tourniquet time was 53 minutes on the left and 45 minutes on the right.,COMPLICATIONS: , There were no intraoperative complications.,DRAINS:,  None.,SPECIMENS: , None.,HARDWARE USED: , Staple 7/8 inch x1 on each side.,HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  ,The patient is a 5-year-4-month-old male who presents for evaluation of feet.  He has been having significant feet pain with significant planovalgus deformity.  The patient was noted to have flexible vertical talus.  It was decided that the patient would benefit by subtalar arthrodesis, possible autograft, and Achilles lengthening.  This was explained to the mother in detail.  This is going to be a stabilizing measure and the patient will probably need additional surgery at a later day when his foot is more mature.  Risks of surgery include risks of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, hardware failure, need for other surgical procedures, need to be nonweightbearing for some time.  All questions were answered and the mother agreed to the above plan.,PROCEDURE NOTE: , The patient was taken to the operating room, placed supine on the operating room, general anesthesia was administered.  The patient received Ancef preoperatively.  Bilateral nonsterile tourniquets were placed on each thigh.  A bump was placed underneath the left buttock.  Both the extremities were then prepped and draped in standard surgical fashion.  Attention was first turned towards the left side.  Intended incision was marked on the skin.  The ankle was taken through a range of motion with noted improvement in the reduction of the talocalcaneal alignment with the foot in plantar flexion on the lateral view.  The foot was wrapped in Esmarch prior to inflation of tourniquet to 200 mmHg.  Incision was then made over the left lateral aspect of the hind foot to expose the talocalcaneal joint.  The sinus tarsi was then identified using a U-shaped flap to tack muscles, and periosteum was retracted distally.  Once the foot was reduced a Steinman pin was used to hold it in position.  This position was first checked on the fluoroscopy.  The 7/8th inch staple was then placed across the sinus tarsi to maintain the reduction.  This was also checked with fluoroscopy.  The incision was then extended posteriorly to allow for visualization of the Achilles, which was Z-lengthened with the release of the lateral distal half.  This was sutured using 2-0 Ethibond and that was also oversewn.  The wound was irrigated with normal saline.  The periosteal flap was sutured over the staple using 2-0 Vicryl.  Skin was closed using 2-0 Vicryl interrupted and then with 4-0 Monocryl.  The area was injected with 6 mL of 0.25% Marcaine local anesthetic.  The wound was cleaned and dried, dressed with Steri-Strips, Xeroform, and 4 x 4s and Webril.  Tourniquet was released after 53 minutes.  The exact same procedure was repeated on the right side with no changes or complications.  Tourniquet time on the right side was 45 minutes.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Bilateral long-leg casts were then placed with the foot in neutral with some moulding of his medial plantar arch.  The patient was subsequently was taken to Recovery in stable condition.,POSTOPERATIVE PLAN: , The patient will be hospitalized overnight for pain as per parents' request.  The patient is to be strict nonweightbearing for at least 6 weeks.  He is to follow up in the next 10 days for a check.  We will plan of changing to short-leg casts in about 4 weeks postop."
248," Vitrectomy. A limited conjunctival peritomy was created with Westcott scissors to expose the supranasal and, separately, the supratemporal and inferotemporal quadrants.  ", Vitrectomy - 3 ,"DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:,  The patient was brought to the operating room and appropriately identified.  Local anesthesia was obtained with a 50/50 mixture of 2% lidocaine and 0.75% bupivacaine given as a peribulbar block.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A lid speculum was used to provide exposure to the right eye.,A limited conjunctival peritomy was created with Westcott scissors to expose the supranasal and, separately, the supratemporal and inferotemporal quadrants.  Calipers were set at 3.5 mm and a mark was made 3.5 mm posterior to the limbus in the inferotemporal quadrant.,A 5-0 nylon suture was passed through partial-thickness sclera on either side of this mark.  The MVR blade was used to make a sclerotomy between the pre-placed sutures.  An 8-0 nylon suture was then pre-placed for later sclerotomy closure.  The infusion cannula was inspected and found to be in good working order.  The infusion cannula was placed in the vitreous cavity and secured with the pre-placed sutures.  The tip of the infusion cannula was directly visualized and found to be free of any overlying tissue and the infusion was turned on.,Additional sclerotomies were made 3.5 mm posterior to the limbus in the supranasal and supratemporal quadrants.  The light pipe and vitrectomy handpieces were then placed in the vitreous cavity and a vitrectomy was performed.  There was moderately severe vitreous hemorrhage, which was removed.  Once a view of the posterior pole could be obtained, there were some diabetic membranes emanating along the arcades.  These were dissected with curved scissors and judicious use of the vitrectomy cutter.  There was some bleeding from the inferotemporal frond.  This was managed by raising the intraocular pressure and using intraocular cautery.  The surgical view became cloudy and the corneal epithelium was removed with a beaver blade.  This improved the view.  There is an area suspicious for retinal break near where the severe traction was inferotemporally.  The Endo laser was used to treat in a panretinal scatter fashion to areas that had not received previous treatment.  The indirect ophthalmoscope was used to examine the retinal peripheral for 360 degrees and no tears, holes or dialyses were seen.  There was some residual hemorrhagic vitreous skirt seen.  The soft-tip cannula was then used to perform an air-fluid exchange.  Additional laser was placed around the suspicious area inferotemporally.  The sclerotomies were then closed with 8-0 nylon suture in an X-fashion, the infusion cannula was removed and it sclerotomy closed with the pre-existing 8-0 nylon suture.,The conjunctiva was closed with 6-0 plain gut.  A subconjunctival injection of Ancef and Decadron were given and a drop of atropine was instilled over the eye.  The lid speculum was removed.  Maxitrol ointment was instilled over the eye and the eye was patched.  The patient was brought to the recovery room in stable condition."

He complained of pain on the medial aspect of his right knee after an injury at work, which he twisted his right knee.,PROCEDURE:  ,After all potential complications, risks, as well as anticipated benefits of the above-named procedures were discussed at length with the patient, informed consent was obtained.  The operative extremity was then confirmed with the operative surgeon, the patient, the Department of Anesthesia and the nursing staff.,The patient was then transferred to preoperative area to Operative Suite #2, placed on the operating table in supine position.  Department of Anesthesia administered general anesthetic to the patient.  All bony prominences were well padded at this time.  The right lower extremity was then properly positioned in a Johnson knee holder.  At this time, 1% lidocaine with epinephrine 20 cc was administered to the right knee intra-articularly under sterile conditions.  The right lower extremity was then sterilely prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  Next, after all bony soft tissue landmarks were identified, an inferolateral working portal was established by making a 1-cm transverse incision at the level of the joint line lateral to the patellar tendon.  The cannula and trocar were then inserted through this, putting the patellofemoral joint.  An arthroscopic camera was then inserted and the knee was sequentially examined including the patellofemoral joint, the medial and lateral gutters, medial lateral joints, and the femoral notch.  Upon viewing of the patellofemoral joint, there was noted to be grade-II chondromalacia changes of the patella.  There were no loose bodies noted in the either gutter.  Upon viewing of the medial compartment, there was no chondromalacia or meniscal tear was noted.  While in this area, attention was directed to establish the inferomedial instrument portal.  This was first done using a spinal needle for localization followed by 1-cm transverse incision at the joint line.  A probe was then inserted through this portal and the meniscus was further probed.  Again, there was noted to be no meniscal tear.  The knee was taken through range of motion and there was no chondromalacia.  Upon viewing of the femoral notch, there was noted to be intact ACL with negative drawer sign.  PCL was also noted to be intact.  Upon viewing of the lateral compartment, there was noted to be a large bucket-handle tear involving the lateral and posterior horns.  It was reduced from the place, however, involved the white and red white area was elected to excise the bucket-handle.  An arthroscopic scissor was then inserted and the two remaining attachments the posterior and lateral attachments were then clipped and a Schlesinger grasper was then used to remove the resected meniscus.  It was noted that the meniscus was followed out to the whole and the entire piece was taken out of the knee.  Pictures were taken both pre-meniscal resection and post-meniscal resection.  The arthroscopic shaver was then inserted into the medial portal and the remaining meniscus was contoured.  The lateral gutter was then examined and was noted to be no loose bodies and ______ was intact.  Next, attention was directed to the inner surface of the patella.  This was debrided using the 2.5 arthroscopic shaver.  It was noted to be quite smooth and postprocedure the patient was taken ________ well.  The knee was then copiously irrigated and suctioned dry and all instrumentation was removed.  20 cc of 0.25% Marcaine was then administered to each portal as well as intra-articularly.,Sterile dressing was then applied consisting of Adaptic, 4x4s, ABDs, and sterile Webril and a stockinette to the right lower extremity.  At this time, Department of Anesthesia reversed the anesthetic.  The patient was transferred back to the hospital gurney to the Postanesthesia Care Unit.  The patient tolerated the procedure and there were no complications."

Lysis of adhesions and renal biopsy.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  100 Ml.,FLUIDS: , Crystalloid.,The patient was bowel prepped and was given preoperative antibiotics.,BRIEF HISTORY: , The patient is a 73-year-old male, who presented to us with a referral from Dr. X's office with bilateral renal mass and renal insufficiency.  The patient's baseline creatinine was around 1.6 to 1.7.  The patient was found to have a 3 to 4-cm exophytic right renal mass, 1-cm renal mass inferior to that, and about 2-cm left renal mass.  Since the patient had bilateral renal disease and the patient had renal insufficiency, the best option at this time had been cryoprocedure for the kidney versus partial nephrectomy, one kidney at a time.  The patient understood all his options, had done some research on cryotherapy and wanted to proceed with the procedure.  The patient had a renal biopsy done, which showed a possibility of an oncocytoma, which also would indicate that if this is not truly a cancerous lesion, but there is an associated risk of renal cell carcinoma that the patient will benefit from a cryo of the kidney.,Risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, hernia, bowel obstruction, ileus, injury to bowel, postoperative bleeding, etc., were discussed.  The patient understood the risk of delayed bleeding, the needing for nephrectomy, renal failure, renal insufficiency, etc., and wanted to proceed with the procedure.,DETAILS OF THE OR:  ,The patient was brought to the OR.  Anesthesia was applied.  The patient was given preoperative antibiotics.  The patient was bowel prepped.  The patient was placed in right side up, left side down, semiflank, with kidney rest up.  All the pressure points are very well padded using foam and towels.  The left knee was bent and the right knee was straight.  There was no tension on any of the joints.  All pressure points were well padded.  The patient was taped to the table using 2-inch wide tape all the way around.  A Foley catheter and OG tube were in place prior to prepping and draping the patient.  A periumbilical incision measuring about 6 cm was made.  The incision was carried through the subcutaneous tissue through the fascia using sharp dissection.  The peritoneum was open.  Abdomen was entered.  There were some adhesions on the right side of the abdomen, which were released using metz.  Two 12-mm ports were placed in the anteroaxillary line and one in the midclavicular line.  A gel porter was placed.  Pneumoperitoneum was obtained.  All ports were placed under direct vision, and the right colon was reflected medially.  Duodenum was cauterized.  Minimal dissection was done on the hilum and the Gerota's was opened laterally, and the renal masses were clearly visualized all the way around.  Pictures were taken.  Superficial biopsies were taken of 2 renal lesions using 3 different probes.  The 2 lesions were frozen.  The 2 probes were 2.4 mm and the other one was 3.1 mm in diameter.  So the R3.8 and R2.4 long probes were used.  Freezing/thawing, two cycles were done.  The temperatures were -131, -137, -150 and the freezing time was 5 and 10 minutes each and passive sign was done.  The exact times or exact temperatures are on the chart.  There was a nice ice ball with each freezing and with passive sign.  The probes were removed.,The probes were placed directly percutaneously through the skin into the renal lesions.,After freezing/thawing, the probes were removed and to seal with Surgicel were placed.  Pictures were taken after following total of 20 minutes were spent looking at the renal mass to make sure that there was no delayed bleeding.  From the time the probes were removed, until the time the laparoscope was removed, was total of 30 minutes.  So the masses were visualized for a total of 30 minutes without any pneumoperitoneum.  Pneumoperitoneum was obtained again.  Fibrin glue was placed over it just for precautionary measure.  There was about a total of 100 mL of blood loss overall with the entire procedure.  Please note that towels were used to prep off the colon and the liver to ensure there was no freezing of any other organ.  The kidney was kept in the left hand at all times.  Careful attention was drawn to make sure that the probe was deep enough, at least 3.5 to 4 cm in, to get the medial aspect of the tumors frozen.  The laparoscopic vacuum ultrasound showed that there was complete resolution of these lesions.  At the end of the procedure, after freezing/thawing and putting the fibrin glue, Surgicel, and EndoSeal, the colon was reflected medially.  Please note that the perirenal fat was placed over the lesion to ensure that the frozen area of the kidney was not exposed to the bowel.  Lap count was correct.  Please note that renal biopsy for permanent section was performed on the superficial aspect of the lesions.  No deeper biopsies were done to minimize the risk of bleeding.  The 12-mm ports were closed using 0-Vicryl and the middle incision.  The hand-port incision was closed using looped #1 PDS from both sides and was tied in the middle.  Please note that the pneumoperitoneum was closed using 0-Vicryl in running fashion.  After closing the abdomen, 4-0 Monocryl was used to close the skin and Dermabond was applied.,The patient was brought to recovery in a stable condition."

258, Cosmetic rhinoplasty.  Request for cosmetic change in the external appearance of the nose., Rhinoplasty ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Nasal obstruction secondary to deviated nasal septum.,2.  Bilateral turbinate hypertrophy.,PROCEDURE:,  Cosmetic rhinoplasty.  Request for cosmetic change in the external appearance of the nose.,ANESTHESIA: , General via endotracheal tube.,INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION:  ,The patient is a 26-year-old white female with longstanding nasal obstruction.  She also has concerns with regard to the external appearance of her nose and is requesting changes in the external appearance of her nose.  From her functional standpoint, she has severe left-sided nasal septal deviation with compensatory inferior turbinate hypertrophy.  From the aesthetic standpoint, the nose is over projected, lacks rotation, and has a large dorsal hump.  First we are going to straighten the nasal septum and reduce the size of the turbinates and then we will also take down the hump, rotate the tip of the nose, and de-project the nasal tip.  I explained to her the risks, benefits, alternatives, and complications for postsurgical procedure.  She had her questions asked and answered and requested that we proceed with surgery as outlined above.,PROCEDURE DETAILS: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in supine position.  The appropriate level of general endotracheal anesthesia was induced.  The face, head, and neck were sterilely prepped and draped.  The nose was anesthetized and vasoconstricted in the usual fashion.  Procedure began with a left hemitransfixion incision, which was brought down into the left intercartilaginous incision.  Right intercartilaginous incision was also made and the dorsum of the nose was elevated in the submucoperichondrial and subperiosteal plane.  Intact bilateral septomucoperichondrial flaps were elevated and a severe left-sided nasal septal deviation was corrected by detachment of the caudal nasal septum from the maxillary crest in a swinging door fashion and placing it back into the midline.  Posterior vomerine spur was divided superiorly and inferiorly and a large spur was removed.  Anterior and inferior one-third of each inferior turbinate was clamped, cut, and resected.  The upper lateral cartilages were divided from their attachments to the dorsal nasal septum and the cartilaginous septum was lowered by approximately 2 mm.  The bony hump of the nose was lowered with a straight osteotome by 4 mm.  Fading medial osteotomies were carried out and lateral osteotomies were then created in order to narrow the bony width of the nose.  The tip of the nose was then addressed via a retrograde dissection and removal of cephalic caudal semicircle cartilage medially at the tip.  The caudal septum was shortened by 2 mm in an angle in order to enhance rotation.  Medial crural footplates were reattached to the caudal nasal septum with a projection rotation control suture of #3-0 chromic.  The upper lateral cartilages were rejoined to the dorsal septum with a #4-0 plain gut suture.  No middle valves or bone grafts were necessary.  Intact mucoperichondrial flaps were closed with 4-0 plain gut suture and Doyle nasal splints were placed on either side of the nasal septum.  The middle meatus was filled with Surgicel and Cortisporin otic and external Denver splint was applied with sterile tape and Mastisol.  Excellent aesthetic and functional results were thus obtained and the patient was awakened in the operating room, taken to the recovery room in good condition."

In the preoperative area, the patient received pilocarpine drops.  The patient received IV propofol and once somnolent from this, a retrobulbar block was administered consisting of 2% Xylocaine plain.  Approximately 3 mL were given.  The operative eye then underwent a Betadine prep with respect to the face, lids, lashes, and eye.  During the draping process, care was taken to isolate the lashes.  A screw type speculum was inserted to maintain patency of lids.  A 6-0 Vicryl suture was placed through the superior cornea, and the eye was reflected downward to expose the superior conjunctiva.  A peritomy was performed approximately 8 to 10 mm posterior to the limbus and this flap was dissected forward to the cornea.  All Tenons were removed from the overlying sclera and the area was treated with wet-field cautery to achieve hemostasis.  A 2 mm x 3 mm scleral flap was then outlined with a Micro-Sharp blade.  This was approximately one-half scleral depth in thickness.  A crescent blade was then used to dissect forward the clear cornea.  Hemostasis was again achieved with wet-field cautery.  A Weck-Cel sponge tip soaked in mitomycin was then placed under the conjunctival and tenon flap and left there for two minutes.  The site was then profusely irrigated with balanced salt solution.  A paracentesis wound was made temporarily and then the Micro-Sharp blade was used to enter the anterior chamber at the anterior most margin of the trabeculectomy bed.  A Kelly-Descemet punch was then inserted, and a trabeculectomy was performed.  Iris was withdrawn through the trabeculectomy site and a peripheral iridectomy was performed using Vannas scissors and 0.12 forceps.  The iris was then repositioned into the eye and the anterior chamber was inflated with BSS.  The scleral flap was sutured in place with two 10-0 nylon sutures with knots trimmed, rotated, and buried.  The overlying conjunctiva was then closed with a running 8-0 Vicryl suture on a BV needle.  BSS was irrigated in the anterior chamber and the blood was noted to elevate nicely without leakage.  Antibiotic and steroid drops were placed in the eye as was homatropine 5%.  The antibiotic consisted of Vigamox and the steroid was Econopred Plus.  A patch and shield were placed over the eye after the drape was removed.  The patient was taken to the recovery room in good condition.  She will be seen in followup in the office tomorrow."

Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.,2.  Arthroscopic subacromial decompression.,3.  Arthroscopic extensive debridement, superior labrum anterior and posterior tear.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After written consent was obtained from the patient, the patient was brought back into the operating room and identified.  The patient was placed on the operating room table in supine position and given general anesthetic.  Once the patient was under general anesthetic, a careful examination of the shoulder was performed.  It revealed no patholigamentous laxity.  The patient was then carefully positioned into a beach-chair position.  We maintained the natural alignment of the head, neck, and thorax at all times.  The shoulder and upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.,Once we fully prepped and draped, we then began the surgery.  We injected the glenohumeral joint with sterile saline with a spinal needle.  This consisted of 60 cc of fluid.  We then made a posterior incision for our portal, 2 cm inferior and 2 cm medial to the posterolateral angle of the acromion.  Through this incision, a blunt trocar and cannula were placed in the glenohumeral joint.  Through the cannula, a camera was placed; and the shoulder was insufflated with sterile saline through a preoperative feed.  We then carefully examined the glenohumeral joint.,We found the articular surface to be in good condition.  There was a superior labral tear (SLAP).  This was extensively debrided using a shaver through an anterior portal.  We also found a full thickness rotator cuff tear.  We then drained the glenohumeral joint.  We redirected our camera into the subacromial space.  An anterolateral portal was made, both superior and inferior.,We then proceeded to perform a subacromial decompression using high-speed shaver.  The bursa was extensively debrided.  We then abraded the bone over the footprint of where the rotator cuff is usually attached.  The corkscrew anchors were used to perform a rotator cuff repair.  Pictures were taken.,Through a separate incision, an indwelling pain catheter was then placed.  It was carefully positioned.  Pictures were taken.  We then drained the joint.  All instruments were removed.  The patient did receive IV antibiotic preoperatively.  All portals were closed using 4-0 nylon sutures.,Xeroform, 4 x 4s, and OpSite were applied over the pain pump.  ABD, tape, and a sling were also applied.  A Cryo/Cuff was also placed over the shoulder.  The patient was taken out of the beach-chair position maintaining the neutral alignment of the head, neck, and thorax.  The patient was extubated and brought to the recovery room in stable condition.  I then went out and spoke with the family, going over the case, postoperative instructions, and followup care."

264, A 92-year-old female had a transient episode of slurred speech and numbness of her left cheek for a few hours. , TIA - Cosult ,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION: , This 92-year-old female states that last night she had a transient episode of slurred speech and numbness of her left cheek for a few hours.  However, the chart indicates that she had recurrent TIAs x3 yesterday, each lasting about 5 minutes with facial drooping and some mental confusion.  She had also complained of blurred vision for several days.  She was brought to the emergency room last night, where she was noted to have a left carotid bruit and was felt to have recurrent TIAs.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , The patient is on Lanoxin, amoxicillin, Hydergine, Cardizem, Lasix, Micro-K and a salt-free diet.  ,SOCIAL HISTORY: , She does not smoke or drink alcohol.,FINDINGS:  ,Admission CT scan of the head showed a densely calcified mass lesion of the sphenoid bone, probably representing the benign osteochondroma seen on previous studies.  CBC was normal, aside from a hemoglobin of 11.2.  ECG showed atrial fibrillation.  BUN was 22, creatinine normal, CPK normal, glucose normal, electrolytes normal.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , On examination, the patient is noted to be alert and fully oriented.  She has some impairment of recent memory.  She is not dysphasic, or apraxic.  Speech is normal and clear.  The head is noted to be normocephalic.  Neck is supple.  Carotid pulses are full bilaterally, with left carotid bruit.  Neurologic exam shows cranial nerve function II through XII to be intact, save for some slight flattening of the left nasolabial fold.  Motor examination shows no drift of the outstretched arms.  There is no tremor or past-pointing.  Finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin performed well bilaterally.  Motor showed intact neuromuscular tone, strength, and coordination in all limbs.  Reflexes 1+ and symmetrical, with bilateral plantar flexion, absent jaw jerk, no snout.  Sensory exam is intact to pinprick touch, vibration, position, temperature, and graphesthesia.,IMPRESSION: , Neurological examination is normal, aside from mild impairment of recent memory, slight flattening of the left nasolabial fold, and left carotid bruit.  She also has atrial fibrillation, apparently chronic.  In view of her age and the fact that she is in chronic atrial fibrillation, I would suspect that she most likely has had an embolic phenomenon as the cause of her TIAs.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,  I would recommend conservative management with antiplatelet agents unless a near occlusion of the carotid arteries is demonstrated, in which case you might consider it best to do an angiography and consider endarterectomy.  In view of her age, I would be reluctant to recommend Coumadin anticoagulation.  I will be happy to follow the patient with you."
265, Patient referred for narrow angles and possible associated glaucoma., Ophthalmology - Letter - 3 ,"XYZ, O.D.,RE:  ABC,DOB:  MM/DD/YYYY,Dear XYZ:,Thank you very much for your kind referral of Mrs. ABC who you referred to me for narrow angles and possible associated glaucoma.  I examined Mrs. ABC initially on MM/DD/YYYY.  At that time, she expressed a chief concern of occasional pain around her eye, but denied any flashing lights, floaters, halos, or true brow ache.  She reports a family history of glaucoma in her mother, but is unsure of the specific kind.  Her past ocular history has been fairly unremarkable.  As you know, she has a history of non-insulin dependent diabetes.  She is unaware of her last hemoglobin A1c levels, but reports a blood sugar of 158 taken on the morning of her appointment with me.  She is followed by Dr. X here locally.,Upon examination, her visual acuity measured 20/20-1 in either eye with her glasses.  Presenting intraocular pressures were14 mmHg in either eye at 2:03 p.m.  Pupillary reactions, confrontational visual fields, and ocular motility were normal.  The slit lamp exam revealed narrow anterior chambers and on gonioscopy only the buried anterior trabecular meshwork was visible in either eye, but the angle deepened with gonio-compression suggesting appositional and not synechial closure.  I deferred the dilated portion of the exam on that day.,We proceeded with peripheral iridectomies and following this upon her most recent visit on MM/DD/YYYY, I was able to safely dilate her eyes as her chambers had deepened and the PIs were patent.  I note that she has an increased CD ratio measuring 0.65 in the right eye and 0.7 in the left and although her FDT visual fields and GDX testing were normal at your office, she does have an enlarged blind spot in either eye on Humphrey visual fields and retinal tomography also shows some suspicious changes.  Therefore, I feel she has sustained some optic nerve damage perhaps from intermittent angle closure in the past.,In summary, Mrs. ABC has a history of narrow angles not successfully treated with laser PIs.  Her intraocular pressures have remained stable.  I will continue to monitor her closely.,Thank you very much once again for allowing me to have shared in her care.  If I can provide any additional information or be of further service, do let me know.,Sincerely,,"

The patient states that the mass has been present for approximately two weeks and has been rapidly growing in size.  The patient also has history of shave biopsy in the past.  The patient does state that he desires surgical excision at this time.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  An IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area.  The patient was transported from the operating room and placed on the operating room table in the supine position with the safety belt across his lap.  Copious amount of Webril was placed around the left ankle followed by a blood pressure cuff.  After adequate sedation by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 6 cc mixed with 1% lidocaine plain with 0.5% Marcaine plain was injected in a digital block fashion at the base of the left hallux as well as the left second toe.,The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion.  The foot was elevated from the operating table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage.  Care was taken with the exsanguination to perform exsanguination below the level of the digits so as not to rupture the masses.  The foot was lowered to the operating table.  The stockinet was reflected and the foot was cleansed with wet and dry sponge.  A distal Syme's incision was planned over the distal aspect of the left hallux.  The incision was performed with a #10 blade and deepened with #15 down to the level of bone.  The dorsal skin flap was removed and dissected in toto off of the distal phalanx.  There was noted to be in growth of the soft tissue mass into the dorsal cortex with erosion in the dorsal cortex and exposure of cortical bone at the distal phalanx.  The tissue was sent to Pathology where Dr. Green stated that a frozen sample would be of less use for examining for cancer.  Dr. Green did state that he felt that there was an adequate incomplete excision of the soft tissue for specimen.  At this time, a sagittal saw was then used to resect all ends of bone of the distal phalanx.  The area was inspected for any remaining suspicious tissues.  Any suspicious tissue was removed.  The area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  The skin was then reapproximated with #4-0 nylon with a combination of simple and vertical mattress sutures.,Attention was then directed to the left second toe.  There was noted to be a dorsolateral mass over the dorsal distal aspect of the left second toe.  A linear incision was made just medial to the tissue mass.  The mass was then dissected from the overlying skin and off of the underlying capsule.  This tissue mass was hard, round, and pearly-gray in appearance.  It does not invade into any other surrounding tissues.  The area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline and the skin was closed with #4-0 nylon.  Dressings consisted of Owen silk soaked in Betadine, 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix, and an Ace wrap.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to all five digits of the left foot.  The patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well without complications.  The patient was transported to PACU with vital signs stable and vascular status intact.  The patient was given postoperative pain prescription for Vicodin and instructed to follow up with Dr. Bonnani in his office as directed.

The patient had a marked dorsal hump, which was both bony and cartilaginous in nature.,2.  The patient had marked hypertrophy of his nasalis muscle bilaterally contributing to the soft tissue dorsal hump.,3.  The patient had a C-shaped deformity to the left before he had tip ptosis.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: , The patient is a 22-year-old Hispanic male who is status post blunt trauma to the nose approximately 9 months with the second episode 2 weeks following and suffered a marked dorsal deformity.  The patient was evaluated, but did not complain of nasal obstruction, and his main complaint was his cosmetic deformity.  He was found to have a C-shaped deformity to the left as well as some tip ptosis.  The patient was recommended to undergo an open septorhinoplasty to repair of this cosmetic defect.,OPERATION IN DETAIL: , After obtaining a full consent from the patient, identified the patient, prepped with Betadine, brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position on the operating table.  The appropriate Esmarch was placed; and after adequate sedation, the patient was subsequently intubated without difficulty.  The endotracheal tube was then secured, and the table was then turned clockwise to 90 degrees.  Three Afrin-soaked cottonoids were then placed in nasal cavity bilaterally.  The septum was then injected with 3 mL of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine in the subperichondrial plane bilaterally.  Then, 50 additional mL of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine was then injected into the nose in preparation for an open rhinoplasty.,Procedure was begun by first marking a columellar incision.  This incision was made using a #15 blade.  A lateral transfixion incision was then made bilaterally using a #15 blade, and then, the columellar incision was completed using iris scissors with care not to injure the medial crura.  However, there was a dissection injury to the left medial crura.  Dissection was then taken in the subperichondrial plane over the lower lateral cartilages and then on to the upper lateral cartilage.  Once we reached the nasal bone, a Freer was used to elevate the tissue overlying the nasal bone in a subperiosteal fashion.  Once we had completed exposure of the bony cartilaginous structures, we appreciated a very large dorsal hump, which was made up of both a cartilaginous and bony portions.  There was also an obvious fracture of the right upper lateral cartilage.  There was also marked hypertrophy what appeared to be in the nasalis muscle in the area of the dorsal hump.  The skin was contributing to the patient's cosmetic deformity.  In addition, we noted what appeared to be a small mucocele coming from the area of the fractured cartilage on the right upper lateral cartilage.  This mucocele was attempted to be dissected free, most of which was removed via dissection.  We then proceeded to remove takedown of the dorsal hump using a Rubin osteotome.  The dorsal hump was taken down and passed off the table.  Examination of the specimen revealed the marking amount of scar tissue at the junction of the bone and cartilage.  This was passed off to use later for possible onlay grafts.  There was now a marked open roof deformity of the cartilage and bony sprue.  A septoplasty was then performed throughout and a Kelly incision on the right side.  Subperichondrial planes were elevated on the right side, and then, a cartilage was incised using a caudal and subperichondrial plane elevated on the left side.  A 2 x 3-cm piece of the cardinal cartilage was then removed with care to leave at least 1 cm dorsal and caudal septal strut.  This cartilage was passed down the table and then 2 columellar strut grafts measuring approximately 15 mm in length were then used and placed to close the bony and cartilaginous open roof deformities.  The spreader grafts were sewn in place using three interrupted 5-0 PDS sutures placed in the horizontal fashion bilaterally.  Once these were placed, we then proceeded to work on the bony open roof.  Lateral osteotomies were made with 2-mm osteotomes bilaterally.  The nasal bones were then fashioned medially to close the open roof deformity, and this reduced the width of the bony nasal dorsum.  We then proceeded to the tip.  A cartilaginous strut was then fashioned from the cartilaginous septum.  It was approximately 15 mm long.  This was placed, and a pocket was just formed between the medial crura.  This pocket was taken down to the nasal spine, and then, the strut graft was placed.  The intradermal sutures were then placed using interrupted 5-0 PDS suture to help to provide more tip projection and definition.  The intradermal sutures were then placed to help to align the nasal tip.  The cartilage strut was then sutured in place to the medial crura after elevating the vestibular skin off the medial crura in the area of the plane suturing.  Prior to the intradermal suturing, the vestibular skin was also taken off in the area of the dome.,The columellar strut was then sutured in place using interrupted 5-0 PDS suture placed in a horizontal mattress fashion with care to help repair the left medial crural foot.  The patient had good tip support after this maneuver.  We then proceeded to repair the septal deformity created by taking down the dorsal hump with the Rubin osteotome.  This was done by crushing the remaining cartilage in the morcellizer and then wrapping this crushed cartilage in endogen, which is a radiated collagen.  The autogenous cartilage was wrapped in endogen in a sandwich fashion, and then, a 4-0 chromic suture was placed through this to help with placement of the dorsal onlay graft.,The dorsal onlay was then sewn into position, and then, the 4-0 chromic suture was brought out through this externally to help the superior placement of the dorsal onlay graft.  Once we were happy with the position of the dorsal onlay graft, the graft was then sutured in place using two interrupted 4-0 fast-absorbing sutures inferiorly just above the superior edge of the lower lateral cartilages.  Once we were happy with the placement of this, we did need to take down some of the bony dorsal hump laterally, and this was done using a #6 and then followed with a #3 push grafts.  This wrapping was performed prior to placement of the dorsal onlay graft.,I went through content with the dorsal onlay graft and the closure of the roof deformities as well as placement of the columellar strut, we then felt the patient could use a bit more tip projection; and therefore, we fashioned a radiated rib into a small octagon; and this was sutured in place over the tip using two interrupted 5-0 PDS sutures.,At this point, we were happy with the test results, although the patient did have significant amount of fullness in the dorsal hump area due to soft tissue thick and fullness.  There do not appear to be any other pathology causing the patient dorsal hump and therefore, we felt we have achieved the best cosmetic result at this point.  The septum was reapproximated using a fast-absorbing 4-0 suture and a Keith needle placed in the mattress fashion.  The Kelly incision was closed using two interrupted 4-0 fast-absorbing gut suture.  Doyle splints were then placed within the nasal cavity and secured to the inferior septum using a 3-0 monofilament suture.  The columellar skin was reapproximated using interrupted 6-0 nylon sutures, and the marginal incision of the vestibular skin was closed using interrupted 4-0 chromic sutures.,At the end of the procedure, all sponge, needle, and instrument counts were correct.  A Denver external splint was then applied.  The patient was awakened, extubated, and transported to Anesthesia Care Unit in good condition."

We had discussed with her in the past beginning to see an internist at the senior center.  She apparently had an appointment scheduled and it was missed.  We are going to reschedule that today given her overall state of well-being and the fact that she has no evidence of GFR that is greater than 60%.,PLAN: , The plan will be for her to follow up at the senior center for her routine health care, and should the need arise for further management of blood pressure, a referral back to us.  In the meantime, we will discharge her from our practice.  Should there be confusion or difficulty getting in the senior center, we can always see her back in followup"

284, Trauma/ATV accident resulting in left open humerus fracture., Discharge Summary - ATV Accident ,"ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS: , Trauma/ATV accident resulting in left open humerus fracture.,DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:,  Trauma/ATV accident resulting in left open humerus fracture.,SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS:,  None.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , For complete details, please see dictated history and physical by Dr. X dated July 23, 2008.  Briefly, the patient is a 10-year-old male who presented to the Hospital Emergency Department following an ATV accident.  He was an unhelmeted passenger on ATV when the driver lost control and the ATV rolled over throwing the passenger and the driver approximately 5 to 10 meters.  The patient denies any loss of consciousness.  He was not amnestic to the event.  He was taken by family members to the Iredell County Hospital, where he was initially evaluated.  Due to the extent of his injuries, he was immediately transferred to Hospital Emergency Department for further evaluation.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , Upon arrival in the Hospital Emergency Department, he was noted to have an open left humerus fracture.  No other apparent injuries.  This was confirmed with radiographic imaging showing that the chest and pelvis x-rays were negative for any acute injury and that the cervical spine x-ray was negative for fracture malalignment.  The left upper extremity x-ray did demonstrate an open left distal humerus fracture.  The orthopedic surgery team was then consulted and upon their evaluation, the patient was taken emergently to the operating room for surgical repair of his left humerus fracture.  In the operating room, the patient was prepared for an irrigation and debridement of what was determined to be an open type 3 subcondylar left distal humerus fracture.  In the operating room, his upper extremity was evaluated for neurovascular status and great care was taken to preserve these structures.  Throughout the duration of the procedure, the patient had a palpable distal radial pulse.  The orthopedic team then completed an open reduction and internal fixation of the left supracondylar humerus fracture.  A wound VAC was then placed over the wound at the conclusion of the procedure.  The patient tolerated this procedure well and was returned to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit for postsurgical followup and monitoring.  His diet was advanced and his pain was controlled with pain medication.  The day following his surgery, the patient was evaluated for a potential for closed head injury given the nature of his accident and the fact that he was not wearing a helmet during his accident.  A CT of the brain without contrast showed no acute intracranial abnormalities moreover his cervical spine was radiographically and clinically cleared and his C-collar was removed at that point.  Once his C spine had been cleared and the absence of a closed head injury was confirmed.  The patient was then transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to the General Floor bed.  His clinical status continued to improve and on July 26, 2008, he was taken back to the operating room for removal of the wound VAC and closure of his left upper extremity wound.  He again tolerated this procedure well on his return to the General Pediatrics Floor.  Throughout his stay, there was concern for compartment syndrome due to the nature and extent of his injuries.  However, frequent checks of his distal pulses indicated that he had strong peripheral pulses in the left upper extremity.  Moreover, the patient had no complaints of paresthesia.  There was no demonstration of pallor or pain on passive motion.  There was good capillary refill to the digits of the left hand.  By the date of the discharge, the patient was on a full pediatric select diet and was tolerating this well.  He had no abdominal tenderness and there were no abdominal injuries on exam or radiographic studies.  He was afebrile and his vital signs were stable and once cleared by Orthopedics, he was deemed appropriate for discharge.,PROCEDURES DURING THIS HOSPITALIZATION:,1.  Irrigation and debridement of open type 3 subcondylar left distal humerus fracture (July 23, 2008).,2.  Open reduction and internal fixation of the left supracondylar humerus fracture (July 23, 2008).,3.  Negative pressure wound dressing (July 23, 2008).,4.  Irrigation and debridement of left elbow fracture (July 26, 2008).,5.  CT of the brain without contrast (July 24, 2008).,DISPOSITION:  ,Home with parents.,INVASIVE LINES: , None.,DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  ,The patient was instructed that he can return home with his regular diet and he was asked not to do any strenuous activities, move furniture, lift heavy objects, or use his left upper extremity.  He was asked to followup with return appointment in one week to see Dr. Y in Orthopedics.  Additionally, he was told to call his pediatrician, if he develops any fevers, pain, loss of sensation, loss of pulse, or discoloration of his fingers, or paleness to his hand."

Biceps tenotomy, right shoulder.,SPECIFICATION: , The entire operative procedure was done in Inpatient Operating Suite, room #1 at ABCD General Hospital.  This was done under interscalene block anesthetic in the modified beachchair position.,HISTORY AND GROSS FINDINGS: , This is a 61-year-old white male who is dominantly right-handed.  He had increasing right shoulder pain and dysfunction for a number of years prior to surgical intervention.  This was gradually done over a period of time.  No specific accident or injury could be seen or pointed.  He was refractory to conservative outpatient therapy.  After discussing alternatives of the care as well as the advantages, disadvantages, risks, complications, and expectations, he elected to undergo the above-stated procedure on this date.,Preoperatively, the patient did not have limitation of motion.  He had gross weakness to his supraspinatus, mildly to the infraspinatus and subscapularis upon strength testing prior to his anesthetic.,Intraarticularly, the patient had an 80% biceps tendon tear that was dislocated.  His rotator interval was resolved as well as his subscapularis with tearing.  The supraspinatus was completely torn, retracted back beyond the level of the labrum and approximately one-third or so of the infraspinatus was involved with the remaining portion being greatly thinned as far as we could observe.  Glenoid labrum had degenerative tear in the inferior surface.  Gross chondromalacia was present to approximately 50% of the humeral head and approximately the upper 40% of the glenoid surface.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient was laid supine upon the operative table.  After receiving interscalene block anesthetic by the Anesthesia Department, he was safely placed in a modified beachchair position.  He was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  The portals were created outside the end posteriorly and then anteriorly.  A full and complete diagnostic arthroscopy was carried out with the above-noted findings.  The shaver was placed anteriorly.  Debridement was carried out to the glenoid labrum tear and the last 20% of the biceps tendon tear was completed.  Debridement was carried out to the end or attachment of the bicep itself.,Debridement was carried out to what could be seen of the remaining rotator cuff there, but then the scope was redirected in a subacromial direction and gross bursectomy carried out.  Debridement was then carried out to the rotator cuff remaining tendon near the tuberosity.  No osteophytes were present.  Because of the massive nature of the tear, the CA ligament was maintained and there were no substantial changes to the subacromial region to necessitate burring.  There was concern because of instability that could be present at the end of this.,Another portal was created laterally to do all of this.  We did what we could to mobilize all sections of the rotator cuff, superiorly, posteriorly, and anteriorly.  We took this back to the level of coracoid base.  We released the coracohumeral ligament basically all but there was no excursion basically all to the portion of the rotator cuff torn.  Because of this, further debridement was carried out.  Debridement had been previously carried out to the humeral head as well as glenoid surface to debride the chondromalacia and take this down to the smooth edge.  Care was taken to not to debride deeper than that.  This was done prior to the above.,All instrumentation was removed.  A Pain-Buster catheter was placed into a separate anterolateral portal cut to length.  Interrupted #4-0 nylon was utilized for portal closures.  Adaptic, 4x4s, ABDs, Elastoplast tape were placed for a compression dressing.,The patient's arm was placed in an arm sling.  He was transferred to his cart and to the PACU in apparent satisfactory condition.  Expected surgical prognosis on this patient is quite guarded because of the above-noted pathology."

A gauze throat pack was placed and local anesthetic was administered in all four quadrants, a total of 6.8 mL of lidocaine 2% with 1:100,000 epinephrine, and 3.6 mL of Marcaine 0.5% with 1:200,000 epinephrine.  The area in the left vestibular area adjacent to the teeth #18 and #19 was aspirated with 5 cc syringe with an 18-guage needle and approximately 1 mL of purulent material was aspirated.  This was placed on the culture medium in the aerobic and anaerobic culture tubes and the tubes were then sent to the lab.  An incision was then made in the left mandibular vestibule adjacent to teeth #18 and #19.  The area was bluntly dissected with a curved hemostat and a small amount of approximately 3 mL of purulent material was drained.  Penrose drain was then placed using a curved hemostat.  The drain was secured with 3-0 silk suture.  The extraction of the teeth was then begun on the left side removing teeth #12, #15, #18 and #19 with forceps extraction, then moving to the right side teeth #2, #5, and #31 were removed with forceps extraction uneventfully.  After completion of the procedure, the throat pack was removed, the pharynx was suctioned.  The anesthesiologist then placed an orogastric tube and suctioned approximately 10 cc of stomach contents with the nasogastric tube.  The nasogastric tube was then removed.  Patient was then extubated and taken to the PACU in stable condition."

The patient had failed conservative measures and having difficulties with her activities of daily living as well as recurrent knee pain and swelling.  The patient requested surgical intervention and need for total knee replacement.,All risks, benefits, expectations, and complications of surgery were explained to her in great detail and she signed informed consent.  All risks including nerve and vessel damage, infection, and revision of surgery as well as component failure were explained to the patient and she did sign informed consent.  The patient was given antibiotics preoperatively.,PROCEDURE DETAIL:  ,The patient was taken to the operating suite and placed in supine position on the operating table.  She was placed in the seated position and a spinal anesthetic was placed, which the patient tolerated well.  The patient was then moved to supine position again and a well-padded tourniquet was placed on the right thigh.  Right lower extremity was prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  All extremities were padded prior to this.,The right lower extremity, after being prepped and draped in the sterile fashion, the tourniquet was elevated and maintained for less than 60 minutes in this case.  A midline incision was made over the right knee and medial parapatellar arthrotomy was performed.  Patella was everted.  The infrapatellar fat pad was incised and medial and lateral meniscectomy was performed and the anterior cruciate ligament was removed.  The posterior cruciate ligament was intact.,There was severe osteoarthritis of the lateral compartment on the lateral femoral condyle as well as mild-to-moderate osteoarthritis in the medial femoral compartment as well severe osteoarthritis along the patellofemoral compartment.  The medial periosteal tissue on the proximal tibia was elevated to the medial collateral ligament and medial collateral ligament was left intact throughout the entirety of the case.,At the extramedullary tibial guide, an extended cut was made adjusting for her alignment.  Once this was performed, excess bone was removed.  The reamer was placed along on the femoral canal, after which a 6-degree valgus distal cut was made along the distal femur.  Once this was performed, the distal femoral size in 3 degrees external rotation, 62.5-mm cutting block was placed in 3 degrees external rotation with anterior and posterior cuts as well as anterior and posterior Chamfer cuts remained in the standard fashion.  Excess bone was removed.,Next, the tibia was brought anterior and excised to 71 mm.  It was then punched in standard fashion adjusting for appropriate rotation along the alignment of the tibia.  Once this was performed, a 71-mm tibial trial was placed as well as a 62.5-mm femoral trial was placed with a 12-mm polyethylene insert.,Next, the patella was cut in the standard fashion measuring 31 mm and a patella bed was placed.  The knee was taken for range of motion; had excellent flexion and extension as well as adequate varus and valgus stability.  There was no loosening appreciated.  There is no laxity appreciated along the posterior cruciate ligament.,Once this was performed, the trial components were removed.  The knee was irrigated with fluid and antibiotics, after which the cement was put on the back table, this being Cobalt G, it was placed on the tibia.  The tibial components were tagged in position and placed on the femur.  The femoral components were tagged into position.  All excess cement was removed ___ placement of patella.  It was tagged in position.  A 12-mm polyethylene insert was placed; knee was held in extension and all excess cement was removed.  The cement hardened with the knee in full extension, after which any extra cement was removed.,The wounds were copiously irrigated with saline and antibiotics, and medial parapatellar arthrotomy was closed with #2 Vicryl.  Subcutaneous tissue was approximated with #2-0 Vicryl and the skin was closed with staples.  The patient was awakened from general anesthetic, transferred to the gurney, and taken into postanesthesia care unit in stable condition.  The patient tolerated the procedure well."

He was initially dry without pads and then underwent salvage radiation therapy for rising PSA.  After that he began with episodes of incontinence as well as urinary retention requiring catheterization.  One year ago, he was unable to catheterize and was taken to the operative room and had cystoscopy.  He had retained staple removed and a diverticulum identified.  There were also bladder stones that were lasered and removed, and he had been incontinent ever since that time.  He wears 8 to 10 pads per day, and this has affected his quality of life significantly.  I took him to the operating room on January 16, 2008, and found diffuse radiation changes with a small capacity bladder and wide-open bladder neck.  We both felt that his lower urinary tract was not rehabilitatable and that a continent cutaneous diversion would solve the number of problems facing him.  I felt like if we could remove the bladder safely, then this would also provide a benefit.,FINDINGS: , At exploration, there were no gross lesions of the smaller or large bowel.  The bladder was predictably sucked into the pelvic sidewall both inferiorly and laterally.  The opened bladder, which we were able to remove completely, had a wide-open capacious diverticulum in its very distal segment.  Because of the previous radiation therapy and a dissection down to the pelvis, I elected to place an omental pedicle flap to provide additional blood supply for healing as well in the pelvis and also under the pubic bone which was exposed inferiorly due to previous surgery and treatment.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was brought to the operative suite and after adequate general endotracheal and epidural anesthesia obtained, placed in the supine position, flexed over the anterosuperior iliac spine, and his abdomen and genitalia were sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  A nasogastric tube was placed as well as radial arterial line.  He was given intravenous antibiotics for prophylaxis.  A generous midline skin incision was made from the midepigastrium down to the symphysis pubis, deep into the rectus fascia, the rectus muscle separated in the midline, and exploration carried out with the findings described.  Moist wound towels and a Bookwalter retractor were placed for exposure.  We began by retracting the bowels by mobilizing the cecum and ascending colon and hepatic flexure and elevating the terminal ileum up to the second and third portion of the duodenum.  The ureter was identified as a crisis over the iliac vessels and dissected deep into pelvis and subsequently divided between clips.  An identical procedure was performed in the left side with similar findings and the bowels were packed cephalad.,We began then dissecting the bladder away from the pelvic side walls staying medial to both epigastric arteries.  This was quite challenging because of the previous radiation therapy and radical prostatectomy.  We essentially carved the bladder off of the pelvic sidewall inferiorly as best we could and then we were able to have enough freedom to identify the lateral pedicles, and these were taken between double clips approximately and clipped distally.  We then approached things posteriorly and carefully dissected between the __________ and posterior bladder.  There was some remnant seminal vesicle on the right as well as both remnant ejaculatory duct and we used this to dissect the longus safe plane anterior to the rectum.  We then entered the bladder anteriorly as distal as we could and remove the bladder and what we thought was a bladder neck and this appeared to end in a diverticulum.  We then peeled it off the remaining rectum and passed the specimen off the operative field.  Bladder was irrigated with warm sterile water and a meticulous inspection was made for hemostasis.,We then completely mobilized the omentum off of the proximal transverse colon.  This allowed a generous flap to be able to be laid into the pelvis without tension.,We then turned our attention to forming the Indiana pouch.  I completed the dissection of the right hepatic flexure and the proximal transverse colon and mobilized the omentum off of this portion of the colon.  The colon was divided proximal to the middle colic using a GIA-80 stapler.  I then divided the avascular plane of Treves along the terminal ileum and selected a point approximately 15 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve to divide the ileum.  The mesentery was then sealed with a LigaSure device and divided, and the bowel was divided with a GIA-60 stapler.  We then performed a side-to-side ileo-transverse colostomy using a GIA-80 stapler, closing the open end with a TA 60.  The angles were reinforced with silk sutures and the mesenteric closed with interrupted silk sutures.,We then removed the staple line along the terminal ileum, passed a 12-French Robinson catheter into the cecal segment, and plicated the ileum with 3 firings of the GIA-60 stapler.  The ileocecal valve was then reinforced with interrupted 3-0 silk sutures as described by Rowland, et al, and following this, passage of an 18-French Robinson catheter was associated with the characteristic ""pop,"" indicating that we had adequately plicated the ileocecal valve.,As the patient had had a previous appendectomy, we made an opening in the cecum in the area of the previous appendectomy.  We then removed the distal staple line along the transverse colon and aligned the cecal end and the distal middle colic end with two 3-0 Vicryl sutures.  The bowel segment was then folded over on itself and the reservoir formed with 3 successive applications of the SGIA Polysorb-75.  Between the staple lines, Vicryl sutures were placed and the defects closed with 3-0 Vicryl suture ligatures.,We then turned our attention to forming the ileocolonic anastomosis.  The left ureter was mobilized and brought underneath the sigmoid mesentery and brought through the mesentery of the terminal ileum and an end-to-side anastomosis performed with an open technique using interrupted 4-0 Vicryl sutures, and this was stented with a Cook 8.4-French ureteral stent, and this was secured to the bowel lumen with a 5-0 chromic suture.  The right ureter was brought underneath the pouch and placed in a stented fashion with an identical anastomosis.  We then brought the stents out through a separate incision cephalad in the pouch and they were secured with a 2-0 chromic suture.  A 24-French Malecot catheter was placed through the cecum and secured with a chromic suture.  The staple lines were then buried with a running 3-0 Vicryl two-layer suture and the open end of the pouch closed with a TA 60 Polysorb suture.  The pouch was filled to 240 cc and noted to be watertight, and the ureteral anastomoses were intact.,We then made a final inspection for hemostasis.  The cecostomy tube was then brought out to the right lower quadrant and secured to the skin with silk sutures.  We then matured our stoma through the umbilicus.  We removed the plug of skin through the umbilicus and delivered the ileal segment through this.  A portion of the ileum was removed and healthy, well-vascularized tissue was matured with interrupted 3-0 chromic sutures.  We left an 18-French Robinson through the stomag and secured this to the skin with silk sutures.  The Malecot and stents were also secured in a similar fashion.,We matured the stoma to the umbilicus with interrupted chromic stitches.  The stitch was brought out to the right upper quadrant and the Malecot to the left lower quadrant.  A Large JP drain was placed in the pelvis dependent to the omentum pedicle flap as well as the Indiana pouch.,The rectus fascia was closed with a buried #2 Prolene running stitch, tying a new figure-of-eight proximally and distally and meeting in the middle and tying it underneath the fascia.  Subcutaneous tissue was irrigated with saline and skin was closed with surgical clips.  The estimated blood loss was 450 mL, and the patient received no packed red blood cells.  The final sponge and needle count were reported to be correct.  The patient was awakened and extubated, and taken on stretcher to the recovery room in satisfactory condition."

Excision of plantar ulceration of the left fifth digit 3 cm x 1 cm in size.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient is a 38-year-old female with longstanding complaint of painful hammertoe deformity of her left fifth toe.  The patient had developed ulceration plantarly after being scheduled for removal of a plantar mass in the same area.  The patient elects for surgical removal of this ulceration and correction of her hammertoe deformity at this time.,After an IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was escorted to the OR where the patient was placed on the Operating Room table in the supine position.  After adequate amount of IV sedation was administered by Anesthesia Department, the patient was given a digital block to the left fifth toe using 0.5% Marcaine plain with 1% lidocaine plain in 1:1 mixture totaling 6 cc.  Following this, the patient was draped and prepped in a normal sterile orthopedic manner.  An ankle tourniquet was placed on the left ankle and the left foot was elevated and Esmarch bandage applied to exsanguinate the foot.  The ankle tourniquet was then inflated to 230 mmHg and then was brought back down to the level of the table.  The stockinette was then cut and reflected and held in place using towel clamp.,The skin was then cleansed using the wet and dry Ray-Tec sponge and then the plantar lesion was outlined.  The lesion measured 1 cm in diameter at the level of the skin and a 3 cm elliptical incision line was drawn on the surface of the skin in the plantolateral aspect of the left fifth digit.  Then using a fresh #15 blade, skin incision was made.  Following this, the incision was then deepened using a fresh #15 blade down to the level of the subcutaneous tissue.  Using a combination of sharp and blunt dissection, the skin was reflected distally and proximally to the lesion.  The lesion appeared well encapsulated with fibrous tissue and through careful dissection using combination of sharp and drill instrumentation the ulceration was removed in its entirety.  The next further exploration was performed to ensure that no residual elements of the fibrous capsular tissue remained within.  The lesion extended from the level of the skin down to the periosteal tissue of the middle and distal phalanx, however, did not show any evidence of extending beyond the level of a periosteum.  Remaining tissues were inspected and appeared healthy.  The lesion was placed in the specimen container and sent to pathology for microanalysis as well as growth.  Attention was then directed to the proximal interphalangeal joint of the left fifth digit and using further dissection with a #15 blade, the periosteum was reflected off the lateral aspect of the proximal ________ median phalanx.  The capsule was also reflected to expose the prominent lateral osseous portion of this joint.  Using a sagittal saw and #139 blade, the lateral osseous prominence was resected.  This was removed in entirety.  Then using power-oscillating rasp, the sharp edges were smoothed and recontoured to the desirable anatomic condition.  Then the incision and wound was flushed using copious amounts of sterile saline with gentamycin.  Following this, the bone was inspected and appeared to be healthy with no evidence of involvement from the removed aforementioned lesion.,Following this, using #4-0 nylon in a combination of horizontal mattress and simple interrupted sutures, the lesion wound was closed and skin was approximated well without tension to the surface skin.  Following this, the incision site was dressed using Owen silk, 4x4s, Kling, and Coban in a normal fashion.  The tourniquet was then deflated and hyperemia was noted to return to digits one through five of the left foot.  The patient was then escorted from the operative table into the Postanesthesia Care Unit.  The patient tolerated the procedure and anesthesia well and was brought to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact.  In the recovery, the patient was given a surgical shoe as well as given instructions for postoperative care to include rest ice and elevation as well as the patient was given prescription for Naprosyn 250 mg to be taken three times daily as well as Vicodin ES to be taken q.6h. as needed.,The patient will follow-up on Friday with Dr. X in office for further evaluation.  The patient was also given instructions as to signs of infection and to monitor her operative site.  The patient was instructed to keep daily dressings intact, clean, dry, and to not remove them."
290, MRI demonstrated right contrast-enhancing temporal mass., SOAP - Temporal Mass ,"SUBJECTIVE: , The patient is a 55-year-old African-American male that was last seen in clinic on 07/29/2008 with diagnosis of new onset seizures and an MRI scan, which demonstrated right contrast-enhancing temporal mass.  Given the characteristics of this mass and his new onset seizures, it is significantly concerning for a high-grade glioma.  ,OBJECTIVE: , The patient is alert and oriented times three, GCS of 15.  Cranial nerves II to XII are grossly intact.  Motor exam demonstrates 5/5 strength in all four extremities.  Sensation is intact to light touch, pain, temperature, and proprioception.  Cerebellar exam is intact.  Gait is normal and tandem on heels and toes.  Speech is appropriate.  Judgment is intact.  Pupils are equal and reactive to light.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: , The patient is a 55-year-old African-American male with a new diagnosis of rim-enhancing right temporal mass.  Given the characteristics of the MRI scan, it is highly likely that he demonstrates high-grade glioma and concerning for glioblastoma multiforme.  We have discussed in length the possible benefits of biopsy, surgical resection, medical management, as well as chemotherapy, radiation treatments, and doing nothing.  Given the high probability that the mass represents a high-grade glioma, the patient, after weighing the risks and the benefits of surgery, has agreed to undergo a surgical biopsy and resection of the mass as well as concomitant chemotherapy and radiation as the diagnosis demonstrates a high-grade glioma.  The patient has signed consent for his right temporal craniotomy for biopsy and likely resection of right temporal brain tumor.  He agrees that he will be n.p.o. after mid night on Wednesday night.  He is sent for preoperative assessment with the Anesthesiology tomorrow morning.  He has undergone vocational rehab assessment."

It was subsequently obstructed with multiple episodes of pyelonephritis, two percutaneous tube placements, ureteroscopy with balloon dilation of the system, and continued obstruction.  Plan is for co surgeons due to the complexity of the situation and the solitary kidney to do surgical procedure to correct the obstruction.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  ,The patient was taken to the operative room.  Surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified.  Dr. X and Dr. Y both agreed upon the procedures in advance.  Dr. Y then, once the patient was anesthetized, requested IV antibiotics with Fortaz, the patient had a caudal block placed, and he was then placed in lithotomy position.  Dr. Y then calibrated the urethra with the bougie a boule to 8, 10, and up to 12 French.  The 9.5-French cystoscope sheath was then placed within the patient's bladder with the offset scope, and his bladder had no evidence of cystitis.  I was able to locate the ureteral orifice bilaterally, although no urine coming from the right.  We then placed a 4-French ureteral catheter into the ureter as far as we could go.  An antegrade nephrostogram was then performed, which shows that the contrast filled the dilated pelvis, but did not go into the ureter.  A retrograde was performed, and it was found that there was a narrowed band across the two.  Upon draining the ureter allowing to drain to gravity, the pelvis which had been clamped and its nephrostomy tube did not drain at all.  Dr. Y then placed a 0.035 guidewire into the ureter after removing the 4-French catheter and then placed a 4.7-French double-J catheter into the ureter as far as it would go allowing it to coil in the bladder.  Once this was completed, we then removed the cystoscope and sheath, placed a 10-French Foley catheter, and the patient was positioned by Dr. X and Dr. Y into the flank position with the left flank up after adequate padding on the arms and legs as well as a brachial plexus roll.  He was then sterilely prepped and draped.  Dr. Y then incised the skin with a 15-blade knife through the old incision and then extended the incision with curved mosquito clamp and Dr. X performed cautery of the areas advanced to be excised.  Once this was then dissected, Dr. Y and Dr. X divided the lumbosacral fascia; at the latissimus dorsi fascia, posterior dorsal lumbotomy maneuver using the electrocautery; and then using curved mosquito clamps __________.  At this point, Dr. X used the cautery to enter the posterior retroperitoneal space through the posterior abdominal fascia.  Dr. Y then used the curved right angle clamp and dissected around towards the ureter, which was markedly adherent to the base of the retroperitoneum.  Dr. X and Dr. Y also needed dissection on the medial and lateral aspects with Dr. Y being on the lateral aspect of the area and Dr. X on the medial to get an adequate length of this.  The tissue was markedly inflamed and had significant adhesions noted.  The patient's spermatic vessels were also in the region as well as the renal vessels markedly scarred close to the ureteropelvic junction.  Ultimately, Dr. Y and Dr. X both with alternating dissection were able to dissect the renal pelvis to a position where Dr. Y put stay sutures and a 4-0 chromic to isolate the four quadrant area where we replaced the ureter.  Dr. X then divided the ureter and suture ligated the base, which was obstructed with a 3-0 chromic suture.  Dr. Y then spatulated the ureter for about 1.5 cm, and the stent was gently delivered in a normal location out of the ureter at the proximal and left alone in the bladder.  Dr. Y then incised the renal pelvis and dissected and opened it enough to allow the new ureteropelvic junction repair to be performed.  Dr. Y then placed interrupted sutures of 5-0 Monocryl at the apex to repair the most dependent portion of the renal pelvis, entered the lateral aspect, interrupted sutures of the repair.  Dr. X then was able to without much difficulty do interrupted sutures on the medial aspect.  The stent was then placed into the bladder in the proper orientation and alternating sutures by Dr. Y and Dr. X closed the ureteropelvic junction without any evidence of leakage.  Once this was complete, we removed the extra stay stitches and watched the ureter lay back into the retroperitoneum in a normal position without any kinking in apparently good position.  This opening was at least 1.5 cm wide.  Dr. Y then placed 2 stay sutures of 2-0 chromic in the lower pole of the kidney and then incised wedge biopsy and excised the biopsy with a 15-blade knife and curved iris scissors for renal biopsy for determination of renal tissue health.  Electrocautery was used on the base.  There was no bleeding, however, and the tissue was quite soft.  Dermabond and Gelfoam were placed, and then Dr. Y closed the biopsy site over with thrombin-Gelfoam using the 2-0 chromic stay sutures.  Dr. X then closed the fascial layers with running suture of 3-0 Vicryl in 3 layers.  Dr. Y closed the Scarpa fascia and the skin with 4-0 Vicryl and 4-0 Rapide respectively.  A 4-0 nylon suture was then placed by Dr. Y around the previous nephrostomy tube, which was again left clamped.  Dermabond tissue adhesive was placed over the incision and then a dry sterile dressing was placed by Dr. Y over the nephrostomy tube site, which was left clamped, and the patient then had a Foley catheter placed in the bladder.  The Foley catheter was then taped to his leg.  A second caudal block was placed for anesthesia, and he is in stable condition upon transfer to recovery room."

Nasal endoscopy.,2.  Partial rhinectomy.,ANESTHESIA:,  General endotracheal.,INDICATIONS: , This is an 81-year-old gentleman who underwent septorhinoplasty many years ago.  He also has a history of a skin lesion, which was removed from the nasal ala many years ago, the details of which he does not recall.  He has been complaining of tenderness and induration of his nasal tip for approximately two years and has been treated unsuccessfully for folliculitis and cellulitis of the nasal tip.  He was evaluated by Dr. A, who performed the septorhinoplasty, and underwent an intranasal biopsy, which showed histologic evidence of invasive squamous cell carcinoma.  The preoperative examination shows induration of the nasal tip without significant erythema.  There is focal tenderness just cephalad to the alar crease.  There is no lesion either externally or intranasally.,PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in supine position.  Following induction of adequate general endotracheal anesthesia, the left nose was decongested with Afrin.  He was prepped and draped in standard fashion.  The left nasal cavity was examined by anterior rhinoscopy.  The septum was midline.  There was slight asymmetry of the nares.  No lesion was seen within the nasal cavity either in the area of the intercartilaginous area, which was biopsied by Dr. A, the septum, the lateral nasal wall, and the floor.  The 0-degree nasal endoscope was then used to examine the nasal cavity more completely.  No lesion was detectable.  A left intercartilaginous incision was made with a #15 blade since this was the area of previous biopsy by Dr. A.  The submucosal tissue was thickened diffusely, but there was no identifiable distinct or circumscribed lesion present.  Random biopsies of the submucosal tissue were taken and submitted to pathology for frozen section.  A diagnosis of diffuse invasive squamous cell carcinoma was rendered.  An alar incision was made with a #15 blade and the full-thickness incision was completed with the electrocautery.  The incision was carried more cephalad through the lower lateral cartilage up to the area of the upper lateral cartilage at the superior margin.  The full unit of the left nasal tip was excised completely and submitted to pathology after tagging and labeling it.  Frozen section examination again revealed diffuse squamous cell carcinoma throughout the soft tissues involving all margins.  Additional soft tissue was then taken from all margins tagging them for the pathologist.  The inferior margins were noted to be clear on the next frozen section report, but there was still disease present in the region of the upper lateral cartilage at its insertion with the nasal bone.  A Joseph elevator was used to elevate the periosteum off the maxillary process and off the inferior aspect of the nasal bone.  Additional soft tissue was taken in these regions along the superior margin.  The frozen section examination revealed persistent disease medially and additional soft tissue was taken and submitted to pathology.  Once all margins had been cleared histologically, additional soft tissue was taken from the entire wound.  A 5-mm chisel was used to take down the inferior aspect of the nasal bone and the medial-most aspect of the maxilla.  This was all submitted to pathology for routine permanent examination.  Xeroform gauze was then fashioned to cover the defect and was sutured along the periphery of the wound with interrupted 6-0 nylon suture to provide a barrier and moisture.  The anesthetic was then discontinued as the patient was extubated and transferred to the PACU in good condition having tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge and needle counts were correct."

304, Invasive carcinoma of left breast. Left modified radical mastectomy., Radical Mastectomy ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Invasive carcinoma of left breast.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Invasive carcinoma of left breast.,OPERATION PERFORMED:,  Left modified radical mastectomy.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal.,INDICATION FOR THE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient is a 52-year-old female who recently underwent a left breast biopsy and was found to have invasive carcinoma of the left breast.  The patient was elected to have a left modified radical mastectomy, she was not interested in a partial mastectomy.  She is aware of the risks and complications of surgery, and wished to proceed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room.  She underwent general endotracheal anesthetic.  The TED stockings and venous compression devices were placed on both lower extremities and they were functioning well.  The patient's left anterior chest wall, neck, axilla, and left arm were prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  The recent biopsy site was located in the upper and outer quadrant of left breast.  The plain incision was marked along the skin.  Tissues and the flaps were injected with 0.25% Marcaine with epinephrine solution and then a transverse elliptical incision was made in the breast of the skin to include nipple areolar complex as well as the recent biopsy site.  The flaps were raised superiorly and just below the clavicle medially to the sternum, laterally towards the latissimus dorsi, rectus abdominus fascia.  Following this, the breast tissue along with the pectoralis major fascia were dissected off the pectoralis major muscle.  The dissection was started medially and extended laterally towards the left axilla.  The breast was removed and then the axillary contents were dissected out.  Left axillary vein and artery were identified and preserved as well as the lung _____.  The patient had several clinically palpable lymph nodes, they were removed with the axillary dissection.  Care was taken to avoid injury to any of the above mentioned neurovascular structures.  After the tissues were irrigated, we made sure there were no signs of bleeding.  Hemostasis had been achieved with Hemoclips.  Hemovac drains x2 were then brought in and placed under the left axilla as well as in the superior and inferior breast flaps.  The subcu was then approximated with interrupted 4-0 Vicryl sutures and skin with clips.  The drains were sutured to the chest wall with 3-0 nylon sutures.  Dressing was applied and the procedure was completed.  The patient went to the recovery room in stable condition."

Negative EKG criteria for ischemia.", Dobutamine Stress Test - 1 ,"DOBUTAMINE STRESS ECHOCARDIOGRAM,REASON FOR EXAM: , Chest discomfort, evaluation for coronary artery disease.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was brought to the cardiac center.  Cardiac images at rest were obtained in the parasternal long and short axis, apical four and apical two views followed by starting with a dobutamine drip in the usual fashion at 10 mcg/kg per minute for low dose, increased every 2 to 3 minutes by 10 mcg/kg per minute.  The patient maximized at 30 mcg/kg per minute.  Images were obtained at that level after adding 0.7 mg of atropine to reach maximal heart rate of 145.  Maximal images were obtained in the same windows of parasternal long and short axis, apical four and apical two windows.,Wall motion assessed at all levels as well as at recovery.,The patient got nauseated, had some mild shortness of breath.  No angina during the procedure and the maximal amount of dobutamine was 30 mcg/kg per minute.,The resting heart rate was 78 with the resting blood pressure 186/98.  Heart rate reduced by the vasodilator effects of dobutamine to 130/80.  Maximal heart rate achieved was 145, which is 85% of age-predicted heart rate.,The EKG at rest showed sinus rhythm with no ST-T wave depression suggestive of ischemia or injury.  Incomplete right bundle-branch block was seen.  The maximal stress test EKG showed sinus tachycardia.  There was subtle upsloping ST depression in III and aVF, which is a normal response to the tachycardia with dobutamine, but no significant depression suggestive of ischemia and no ST elevation seen.,No ventricular tachycardia or ventricular ectopy seen during the test.  The heart rate recovered in a normal fashion after using metoprolol 5 mg.,The heart images were somewhat suboptimal to evaluate because of obesity and some problems with the short axis windows mainly at peak exercise.,The EF at rest appeared to be normal at 55 to 60 with normal wall motion including anterior, anteroseptal, inferior, lateral, and septal walls at low dose.  All walls mentioned were augmented in a normal fashion.  At maximum dose, all walls were augmented on all views except for the short axis was foreshortened, was uncertain about the anterolateral wall at peak exercise; however, of the other views, the lateral wall was showing normal thickening and normal augmentation.  EF improved to about 70%.,The wall motion score was unchanged.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Maximal dobutamine stress echocardiogram test achieving more than 85% of age-predicted heart rate.,2.  Negative EKG criteria for ischemia.,3.  Normal augmentation at low and maximum stress test with some uncertainty about the anterolateral wall in peak exercise only on the short axis view.  This is considered the negative dobutamine stress echocardiogram test, medical management."

Fractured and retained lumbar subarachnoid spinal catheter.,2.  Pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension).,PROCEDURES:  ,1.  L1 laminotomy.,2.  Microdissection.,3.  Retrieval of foreign body (retained lumbar spinal catheter).,4.  Attempted insertion of new external lumbar drain.,5.  Fluoroscopy.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,HISTORY:  ,The patient had a lumbar subarachnoid drain placed yesterday.  All went well with the surgery.  The catheter stopped draining and on pulling back the catheter, it fractured and CT scan showed that the remaining fragment is deep to the lamina.  The patient continues to have right eye blindness and headaches, presumably from the pseudotumor cerebri.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,After induction of general anesthesia, the patient was placed prone on the operating room table resting on chest rolls.  Her face was resting in a pink foam headrest.  Extreme care was taken positioning her because she weighs 92 kg.  There was a lot of extra padding for her limbs and her limbs were positioned comfortably.  The arms were not hyperextended.  Great care was taken with positioning of the head and making sure there was no pressure on her eyes especially since she already has visual disturbance.  A Foley catheter was in place.  She received IV Cipro 400 mg because she is allergic to most antibiotics.,Fluoroscopy was used to locate the lower end of the fractured catheter and the skin was marked.  It was also marked where we would try to insert the new catheter at the L4 or L3 interspinous space.,The patient was then prepped and draped in a sterile manner.,A 7-cm incision was made over the L1 lamina.  The incision was carried down through the fascia all the way down to the spinous processes.  A self-retaining McCullough retractor was placed.  The laminae were quite deep.  The microscope was brought in and using the Midas Rex drill with the AM-8 bit and removing some of the spinous process of L1-L2 with double-action rongeurs, the laminotomy was then done using the drill and great care was taken and using a 2-mm rongeur, the last layer of lamina was removed exposing the epidural fat and dura.  The opening in the bone was 1.5 x 1.5 cm.,Occasionally, bipolar cautery was used for bleeding of epidural veins, but this cautery was kept to a minimum.,Under high magnification, the dura was opened with an 11 blade and microscissors.  At first, there was a linear incision vertically to the left of midline, and I then needed to make a horizontal incision more towards the right.  The upper aspect of the cauda equina was visualized and perhaps the lower end of the conus.  Microdissection under high magnification did not expose the catheter.  The fluoroscope was brought in 2 more times including getting a lateral view and the fluoroscope appeared to show that the catheter should be in this location.,I persisted with intensive microdissection and finally we could see the catheter deep to the nerves and I was able to pull it out with the microforceps.,The wound was irrigated with bacitracin irrigation.,At this point, I then attempted lumbar puncture by making a small incision with an 11 blade in the L4 interspinous space and then later in the L3 interspinous space and attempted to puncture the dural sac with the Tuohy needle.  Dr. Y also tried.  Despite using the fluoroscope and our best attempts, we were not able to convincingly puncture the lumbar subarachnoid space and so the attempted placement of the new lumbar catheter had to be abandoned.  It will be done at a later date.,I felt it was unsafe to place a new catheter at this existing laminotomy site because it was very high up near the conus.  The potential for complications involving her spinal cord was greater and we have already had a complication of the catheter now and I just did not think it was safe to put in this location.,Under high magnification, the dura was closed with #6-0 PDS interrupted sutures.,After the dura was closed, a piece of Gelfoam was placed over the dura.  The paraspinous muscles were closed with 0 Vicryl interrupted sutures.  The subcutaneous fascia was also closed with 0 Vicryl interrupted suture.  The subcutaneous layer was closed with #2-0 Vicryl interrupted suture and the skin with #4-0 Vicryl Rapide.  The 4-0 Vicryl Rapide sutures were also used at the lumbar puncture sites to close the skin.,The patient was then turned carefully on to her bed after sterile dressings were applied and then taken to the recovery room.  The patient tolerated procedure well.  No complications.  Sponge and needle counts correct.  Blood loss minimal, none replaced.  This procedure took 5 hours.  This case was also extremely difficult due to patient's size and the difficulty of locating the catheter deep to the cauda equina."
307, The patient was referred for an outpatient speech and language pathology consult to increase speech and swallowing abilities.  The patient is currently NPO with G-tube to meet all of his hydration and nutritional needs.  A trial of Passy-Muir valve was completed to allow the patient to achieve hands-free voicing., Barium Swallow Study & Speech Evaluation ,"CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,  Lortab.,PREVIOUS MEDICAL HISTORY: , Cardiac stent in 2000.,PATIENT'S GOAL: , To eat again by mouth.,STUDY:  ,A trial of Passy-Muir valve was completed to allow the patient to achieve hands-free voicing and also to improve his secretion management.  A clinical swallow evaluation was not completed due to the severity of the patient's mucus and lack of saliva control.,The patient's laryngeal area was palpated during a dry swallow and he does have significantly reduced laryngeal elevation and radiation fibrosis.  The further evaluate of his swallowing function is safety; a modified barium swallow study needs to be concluded to objectively evaluate his swallow safety, and to rule out aspiration.  A trial of neuromuscular electrical stimulation therapy was completed to determine if this therapy protocol will be beneficial and improving the patient's swallowing function and safety.,For his neuromuscular electrical stimulation therapy, the type was BMR with a single mode cycle time is 4 seconds and 12 seconds off with frequency was 60 __________ with a ramp of 2 seconds, phase duration was 220 with an output of 99 milliamps.  Electrodes were placed on the suprahyoid/submandibular triangle with an upright body position, trial length was 10 minutes.  On a pain scale, the patient reported no pain with the electrical stimulation therapy.,FINDINGS:  ,The patient was able to tolerate a 5-minute placement of the Passy-Muir valve.  He reported no discomfort on the inhalation; however, he felt some resistance on exhalation.  Instructions were given on care placement and cleaning of the Passy-Muir valve.  The patient was instructed to buildup tolerance over the next several days of his Passy-Muir valve and to remove the valve at anytime or he is going to be sleeping or napping throughout the day.  The patient's voicing did improve with the Passy-Muir valve due to decreased leakage from his trach secondary to finger occlusion.  Mucus production also seemed to decrease when the Passy-Muir was placed.,On the dry swallow during this evaluation, the patient's laryngeal area is reduced and tissues around his larynx and showed radiation fibrosis.  The patient's neck range of motion appears to be adequate and within normal limits.,A trial of neuromuscular electrical stimulation therapy:,The patient tolerating the neuromuscular electrical stimulation, we did achieve poor passive response, but these muscles were contracting and the larynx was moving upon stimulation.  The patient was able to actively swallow with stimulation approximately 30% of presentation.,DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION: , The patient with a history of head and neck cancer status post radiation and chemotherapy with radiation fibrosis, which is impeding his swallowing abilities.  The patient would benefit from outpatient skilled speech therapy for neuromuscular electrical stimulation for muscle reeducation to improve his swallowing function and safety and he would benefit from a placement of a Passy-Muir valve to have hands-free communication.,PLAN OF CARE: , Outpatient skilled speech therapy two times a week to include neuromuscular electrical stimulation therapy, Passy-Muir placement and a completion of the modified barium swallow study.,SHORT-TERM GOALS (6 WEEKS):,1.  Completion of modified barium swallow study.,2.  The patient will coordinate volitional swallow with greater than 75% of the neuromuscular electrical stimulations.,3.  The patient will increase laryngeal elevation by 50% for airway protection.,4.  The patient will tolerate placement of Passy-Muir valve for greater than 2 hours during awaking hours.,5.  The patient will tolerate therapeutic feedings with the speech and language pathologist without signs and symptoms of aspiration.,6.  The patient will decrease mild facial restrictions to the anterior neck by 50% to increase laryngeal movement.,LONG-TERM GOALS (8 WEEKS):,1.  The patient will improve secretion management to tolerable levels.,2.  The patient will increase amount and oral consistency of p.o. intake tolerated without signs and symptoms of aspirations.,3.  The patient will be able to communicate without using finger occlusion with the assistance of a Passy-Muir valve."

She has been hospitalized multiple times for intractable nausea and vomiting and dehydration.  She states that her decreased p.o. intake has been progressively worsening.  She was admitted to the service of Dr. Lang and was evaluated by Dr. Wickless as well all of whom agreed that the best option for supplemental nutrition for this patient was placement of a PEG tube.,PROCEDURE: , After risks, complications, and benefits were explained to the patient and informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the operating room.  She was placed in the supine position.  The area was prepped and draped in the sterile fashion.  After adequate IV sedation was obtained by anesthesia, esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed.  The esophagus, stomach, and duodenum were visualized without difficulty.  There was no gross evidence of any malignancy.  There was some enterogastritis which was noted upon exam.  The appropriate location was noted on the anterior wall of the stomach.  This area was localized externally with 1% lidocaine.  Large gauge needle was used to enter the lumen of the stomach under visualization.  A guide wire was then passed again under visualization and the needle was subsequently removed.  A scalpel was used to make a small incision, next to the guidewire and ensuring that the underlying fascia was nicked as well.  A dilator with break-away sheath was then inserted over the guidewire and under direct visualization was seen to enter the lumen of the stomach without difficulty.  The guidewire and dilator were then removed again under visualization and the PEG tube was placed through the break-away sheath and visualized within the lumen of the stomach.  The balloon was then insufflated and the break-away sheath was then pulled away.  Proper placement of the tube was ensured through visualization with a scope.  The tube was then sutured into place using nylon suture.  Appropriate sterile dressing was applied.,DISPOSITION:  ,The patient was transferred to the recovery in a stable condition.  She was subsequently returned to her room on the General Medical Floor.  Previous orders will be resumed.  We will instruct the Nursing that the PEG tube can be used at 5 p.m. this evening for medications if necessary and bolus feedings."
310, Consultation for FCR tendinitis, FCR tendinitis ,"HISTORY OF PRESENT PROBLEM:,  XYZ was seen by Dr. ABC for an FCR tendinitis.  We do not have his reports, but by history she has had two cortisone shots.  She plays musical instruments, and it does bother her from time to time.  She was considering surgery, but she takes ibuprofen and it seems to be well-controlled.  She is here now for consultation. ,CLINICAL/PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , ,General:  The patient is alert and oriented times three in no acute distress. ,Skin:  No skin breakdown or hyperhidrosis.,Vascular:  2+ radial and ulnar artery pulses.,Musculoskeletal:  Wrist, elbow, shoulder and neck exams reveal no focal findings except for some tenderness to palpation over the FCR tendon on the scaphoid tubercle, but there is no SL instability and no signs of lunotriquetral instability or midcarpal instability.  The DRUJ is stable.  Flexion/extension of the fingers is all intact.  Forearm, elbow and shoulder exams reveal no other focal tenderness to palpation.,Neurologic:  Negative Tinel's, Phalen's and compression median nerve test.  APB, EPL and first dorsal interosseous have 5/5 strength.  Forearm, elbow and shoulder exams reveal no neurologic compromise.,Gait:  Normal.,Neck:  Negative Spurling sign.  Negative signs of thoracic outlet.,HEENT:  Pupils equal and reactive with no asymmetry.,CLINICAL IMPRESSION:,  By history, possible FCR tendinitis.,EVALUATION/TREATMENT PLAN:  At this point, we have asked her some questions again.  She is not that sore at this point, and she has had a couple of cortisone shots.  Without being the initial treating physician, she has FCR tendinitis that fails to respond to cortisone shots.  She is a candidate for an FCR tunnel release.  It has been described and is effective for those patients with that problem.  My only consideration would be, if the patient should choose, to get an MRI when she is symptomatic to confirm the FCR tendinitis.  She will followup with Dr. ABC as needed or come back to us when she is thinking more along the lines of surgery."

Following the induction of satisfactory general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient was prepared for surgery.  A shoulder roll was placed between the scapula and the head was rested on a doughnut in a slightly extended position.  A preoperative x-ray was obtained to identify the operative level and neck position.  An incision was marked at the C4-C5 level on the right side.  The incision was opened with #10 blade knife.  Dissection was carried down through subcutaneous tissues using Bovie electrocautery.  The platysma muscle was divided with the cautery and mobilized rostrally and caudally.  The anterior border of sternocleidomastoid muscle was then dissected rostrally and caudally with sharp and blunt dissection.  The avascular plane was then entered and dissection was carried bluntly down to the anterior cervical fascia.  This was opened with scissors and dissected rostrally and caudally with the peanut dissectors.  The operative level was confirmed with an intraoperative x-ray.  The longus colli muscles were mobilized bilaterally using bipolar electrocautery and periosteal elevator.  The anterior longitudinal ligament was then taken down with the insulated Bovie electrocautery tip exposing the vertebral bodies of C4 and C5.  Self-retaining retractor was placed in submuscular position, and distraction pins were placed in the vertebral bodies of C4 and C5, and distraction was instituted.  We then incise the annulus of C4-C5 and a discectomy was now carried out using pituitary rongeurs and straight and angled curettes.  Operating microscope was draped and brought into play.  Dissection was carried down through the disc space to the posterior aspect of the disc space removing the disc with the angled curette as we went.  We now use the diamond bit to thin the posterior bone spurs and osteophytes at the uncovertebral joints bilaterally.  Bone was then removed with 2 mm Kerrison punch and then we were able to traverse the posterior longitudinal ligament and this ligament was now removed in a piecemeal fashion with a 2 mm Kerrison punch.  There was a transligamentous disc herniation, which was removed during this process.  We then carried out bilateral foraminotomies with removal of the uncovertebral osteophytes until the foramina were widely patent.  Cord was seen to be pulsating freely behind the dura.  There appeared to be no complications and the decompression appeared adequate.  We now used a cutting bit to prepare the inner space for arthrodesis fashioning a posterior ledge on the posterior aspect of the C5 vertebral body.  An 8 mm lordotic trial was used and appeared perfect.  We then used a corticocancellous 8 mm lordotic graft.  This was tapped into position.  Distraction was released, appeared to be in excellent position.  We then positioned an 18 mm Vector plate over the inner space.  Intraoperative x-ray was obtained with the stay screw in place; plates appeared to be in excellent position.  We then use a 14 mm self-tapping variable angle screws in each of the four locations drilling 14 mm pilot holes at each location prior to screw insertion.  All of the screws locked to the plate and this was confirmed on visual inspection.  Intraoperative x-ray was again obtained.  Construct appeared satisfactory.  Attention was then directed to closure.  The wound was copiously irrigated.  All of the self-retaining retractors were removed.  Bleeding points were controlled with bone wax and bipolar electrocautery.  The platysma layer was now closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl sutures.  The skin was closed with running 3-0 Vicryl subcuticular stitch.  Steri-Strips were applied.  A sterile bandage was applied.  All sponge, needle, and cottonoid counts were reported as correct.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  He was subsequently extubated in the operating room and transferred to PACU in satisfactory condition."
